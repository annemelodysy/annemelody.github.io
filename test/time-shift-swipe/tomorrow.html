        <p><span class="date">March 24, 2018</span> &ndash; Your plans for the next several days won't go off exactly as you'd expected. In fact, they probably won't be anything you can really count on. Basically, it's going to be like Murphy's Law &mdash; whatever can go wrong will go wrong. Try not to get too frustrated with others &mdash; it's not their fault. Fortunately, if anyone is good at coming up with Plan B or C or D at a moment's notice, it's you. Start making those plans now.</p>
