      <p>You approach love at full tilt, Aries, so when love goddess Venus joins dreamy Neptune in imaginative Pisces at the end of February, you’re out of your element. But that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Because this is the only time this aspect occurs this year, give yourself some creative freedom in the bedroom. Indulge your fantasies. Role play. Trade in your usual raw, potent sexuality for dreamy, romantic scenarios filled with soft music and candlelight and see where it takes you. </p>
      <p>A spark-producing Mars-Uranus square stirs up inner turmoil mid-May, when you may dwell on things in your love life that you can’t change. It doesn’t do you any good to obsess over what could have been or what you wish would be, but you can’t seem to stop yourself. You don’t do well when you feel powerless, which could cause you to act impulsively and, let’s face it, rather desperately. This would be a good time to blow off some steam away from everyone else. Take out your romantic frustrations by joining a kickboxing class, or write down how you’re feeling in a journal or anonymous blog. Try to resist the urge to lash out at others, though, especially if they don’t have anything to do with your current situation.</p>
