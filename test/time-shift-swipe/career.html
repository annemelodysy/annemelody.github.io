      <p>When articulate Mercury in your competitive sign turns retrograde at the end of March, Aries, it goes against your intense nature. True mental toughness is imperative because the divide between what you’re asked to do and what you’re able to accomplish will probably be vast and deep. Sure, you can come up with plenty of reasons why your assignment isn’t finished or why you can’t complete your tasks by their deadlines, but reasons don’t equal excuses. If you can’t do your job to the best of your ability, you aren’t happy. And an unhappy Aries in the workplace (or an unfulfilled or underappreciated Aries) is not a pretty sight.</p>
      <p>Power-hungry Mars enters technological Aquarius in the middle of May, so technology will be in the forefront for the next six months. This can be an unpredictable combination at times, due to the Water Bearer’s eccentric nature, but you can reach a lot of breakthroughs if you’re willing to roll with the ups and downs. Taking the most unconventional approach to your responsibilities will work best, and thinking outside the box will be rewarded in unforeseen yet positive ways. This is a good time to be (or market yourself as) a team player, because while you like individual achievements, being less concerned with your individual contributions will net you the best results.</p>
