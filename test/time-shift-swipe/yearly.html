      <p>What does 2018 have in store for you, powerful Aries? It looks like you can expect some instability and turbulence coupled with growth, which isn’t a bad combo for a sign that’s known for persevering no matter what!</p>
      <p>Your year kicks into high gear when the sun enters your assertive sign at the end of March, and you go for what you want for the next month. Your sign rules the head, so, superficially, wearing hats and getting facials top off your downtime to-do list. Go beyond the surface, though, and you’ll find your brain hard at work trying to solve a nagging problem that’s been hindering your forward progress.</p>
      <p>Forceful Mars, your power planet, turns retrograde for a couple months at the end of June, giving you a time-out with anger issues. Stay calm. Play it cool. For once, let other people stress about the things they can’t change, because you’ve been there, done that. You may try to do more than you’re capable of during a trying Mars-Jupiter square in mid-November, but once the frustration lifts you’ll see the battle wasn’t pointless - even if you don’t emerge the winner. Seeing all struggles as potential learning opportunities is what sets you apart from the competition.</p>
