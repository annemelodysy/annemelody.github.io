    <p>This is pretty much a very late blog post but I have an excuse because I just finished designing my website <strong>AGAIN</strong>. This has been in the works since earlier months but I got too busy with other projects so I couldn't focus on it. <em>Excuses, excuses</em>.</p>
    <p>Let me go back to the main blog, I seem to have wandered to a different direction.</p>
    <p>A few months ago, we heard that DCFC was coming to the country. Jeremie and I had been crazy about Death Cab since we first heard about them. Actually, he introduced the songs to me back when we were just dating. I remember he had this status on his messenger that said "<em>A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere</em>" and I thought it was about me until he sent me the song. D'oh!</p>
    <p>That memory on the 5th of March still floats inside my head and every time I look at the pictures, the same emotions come out. Everything fell into place--the crowd, the music, the weather.</p>

    <p>This was I think the day before the concert. We gathered with some friends and walked underneath giants while talking about how excited we were of the following day and how we all shared this love for their music.</p>

    <p>Macoy, Toni, & Carlo going ahead of us. We were trying to find Merkato–which was sadly closed at that time.</p>

    <p>We passed by several sleepy-looking buildings that I imagine having drowsy eyes and yawning as we walked pass them.</p>

    <p>Just a few hours before the concert, the Cebu team decided to enjoy a delicious Mexican dinner. The gap in the middle is making me uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Then we saw the line grow and grow. At first we thought that this was a lesser-known band and probably not a lot of people would be there early. But then we were wrong! This was how <i>part</i> of the line looks like a couple of hours before the concert.</p>
    <p>After all that waiting, we found ourselves inside, happily singing the songs we wanted them to play. I was rooting for <i>‘What Sarah Said‘</i>, <i>‘I will follow you into the dark‘</i> and <i>‘Cath‘</i>.</p>

    <p>Luckily, all the songs I wanted to hear were played! Especially What Sarah Said pictured below. The emotions of watching them play that song while the light show did its trick gave me goosebumps!</p>

    <p>Someone showing some love.</p>
    <p>The night ended with the perfect song–<i>Transatlanticism</i>. Perfect.</p>

    <p>Other than the concert, we decided to eat and eat, like we always do when we’re in Manila.</p>

    <p>Toni and me having fun at Ronac Art Center near Greenhills + the dreamy coffee shop that looked like it was going to roll any minute.</p>

    <p>And here’s a photo of our trusty bags, which coincidentally looks similar. Only mine is smaller.</p>
    <p>I like to travel light.</p>
