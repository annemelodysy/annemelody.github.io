          <p>There’s something magical about trains. I used to daydream a lot about just sitting down by the window and watching the outside world transition into abstract shapes and colors. In Thailand, I slept in my first overnight train as <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/and-the-final-stop-chiang-mai/" target="_blank">I traveled from Ayutthaya to Chiang Mai</a>. The gentle rocking and the soft murmur of the train’s engine as we cut through the scenic mountains are still running through my head.</p>
          <p>That experience left me wanting more so I booked two bunk beds for Jeremie and I to sleep in as we travel to Berlin. From Amsterdam, we had to take a local train to Duisburg where we would be boarding our overnight train. Our first goal was to figure out how the train system worked in Europe so we arrived early at the station. When the man in the counter gave us back our Eurail passes, we noticed there was no platform number on the ticket.</p>
          <p>We found out from the man in the counter that the platform number will appear on the screens five minutes before the schedule and that trains don’t usually stay longer than five to ten minutes before it's on its way. He also added that we had to board the right car or end up in Zurich.</p>
          <p>Thank the universe I was conveniently carrying a backpack and a small shoulder bag rather than a luggage. I can't imagine how someone would be dragging it around while searching for the right car. Packing light proved to be a good move for us.</p>
          <p>Due to all the running, we were exhausted when we finally got inside the train so I dozed off almost immediately after finding our seats. Nothing is more relaxing than having your plans work out without any problems. Little did I know this was only the beginning.</p>
          <p>I kept drifting from a state of unconsciousness to consciousness and it wasn’t because the chairs were hard to sleep in (although a bed would have been better) but I realized it was because there’s this guy a few rows ahead that’s talking loudly. It was as though he thought he was the only person in the train. Either that or he was trying to impress this girl sitting next to him with his newly developed language skill. My cranky outlook was fueled by the lack of sleep and hunger. Two things that never go well together. I made a mental note to look for a snack counter on the next stop.</p>
          <p>The next stop looked like any other stations we had passed by--dark, empty, depressing. I didn't realize there was anything wrong at that point until the conductor appeared in our car. He announced that we were only two stations away from Duisburg but a sudden nationwide power outage had occured and no train could operate while this was happening. He also told us he didn’t know when we could start moving again before he disappeared in the next train.</p>
          <p>Jeremie and I decided to explore the rest of the train while waiting. We were hungry so we decided to look for food. Unfortunately, everyone else was hungry too and the snack stations ran out of food. We passed through doors that connected each car and I could not help but think about those Hollywood action movies where people jump from one car to the next while the train is moving. I couldn’t count the number of cars we had gone through but it felt like there was no end. We eventually got tired and headed back, slightly disappointed that we didn’t reach the front of the train.</p>
          <p>An hour had passed and there was definitely no way we could make it to our next train. Still stuck, we ended up talking to this nice person who gave us tips on what to eat and what to do in Berlin. It was great to hear stories from someone who lived in the area.</p>
          <p>Then finally, we started moving! But wait, why are we moving backwards? Seriously, are we going back to Amsterdam after all that waiting?</p>
          <p>The conductor popped out again like a ghost moving from one car to the next. His face tired and stressed probably from all the complaints he’s gotten from the passengers. He announced that there was a change in our destination. Instead of going to Duisburg, we were taking a different route so that people who wanted to reach Berlin should stop at Cologne’s train station. At this point, I was too tired to complain. I was just happy that we weren’t stuck anymore and that we were finally moving.</p>
          <p>Not part of the plan, and we didn’t expect this to happen but at least we were getting somewhere. Forget the overnight train, forget sleep. Whatever. We’ll figure out how to reach Berlin when we get there.</p>
          <p>Cologne at first sight looked like any other train station in Europe. Looking back now, I should have noticed the "sketchy" people who were staring at us as we bought bread in the only shop that was open. The same people who probably watched as I opened my small shoulder bag and took out my wallet to pay the cashier. I should have turned on that part of my brain that tells me to be alert but we were too tired and stressed out.</p>
          <p>As we were about to sit down on one of the benches to wait for our train to Berlin, a man came up to us and asked us where this particular platform was. Now I know this would have been a red flag. Why would someone who looked like a local ask a couple of "outsiders" where this particular platform was but I brushed it off thinking he must have also been a visitor. As I was about to sit down on the bench, I felt my heart sink to the bottom of my feet. Something seemed utterly wrong. On the spot where I was absolutely sure I placed my shoulder bag, there was nothing in there. I panicked and asked Jeremie if he saw where the bag was but he looked confused. For a split second I considered that maybe I left the bag in the bakery while we were buying bread but I was absolutely certain I had it wrapped around my body.</p>
          <p>I felt every ounce of blood in my body rush to my head. At this point I was certain about what was happening. There was only one explanation, how could I be so stupid and naive? At this point I knew that this was a clearly organised modus and that the man who was asking us a question was distracting us while someone else probably grabbed my bag as I placed it on the bench. Shock turned to rage and I quickly followed my first instinct. Without telling Jeremie, I ran as fast as I could towards this man who was walking casually several meters away (opposite direction to where the man who distracted us was walking towards). I didn’t care that my backpack was weighing me down. I didn’t even think about whether I was right or wrong but I followed my first instinct. I caught up with the man who did not even realise I was behind him. Stealthily, and as I got closer, I saw a familiar blue and grey strap hanging on his right shoulder and I quickly pulled the strap away from him and towards me. Luckily, by some great miracle, it was my bag! What I did startled him and I heard him mutter a few lines before walking casually away as if nothing had happened. I securely wrapped the bag around my body and screamed as many profanities as I could at this pathetic excuse of a human being. Back home, people always advice you to not intervene with these criminals to avoid getting hurt but I didn’t care at that point. I was ready to fight him. I didn’t care about consequences, I just wanted to get even.</p>
          <p>Jeremie at this point finally caught up with me and was extremely clueless about what just happened. The rest of the bystanders stared at me as though I was crazy. They all knew what was happening and yet they said nothing. They did nothing. They were all part of the scheme. I even saw one or two men laughing. I was so pumped up and mad that I continued muttering profanities under my breath as we quickly left the area.</p>
          <p>Deciding that the safest plan would just be to wait in the platform, where there were hopefully normal people, we took the escalator and it was then that we caught a glimpse of the accomplice (the man who asked us a question earlier) looking at us, probably making sure we weren’t causing them trouble. I stared at him still mad and at the same time my body shaking from the realisation that we could have lost all our important documents. I wrapped the bag tightly around me and kept it so close that it almost felt like it was now part of my body.</p>
          <p>Everything that happened was looping in my head and I couldn’t get over the fact that we were lucky to be able to recover our bag before the man disappeared around the corner. I can’t imagine what we would do if we didn’t figure out that someone took our bag, or that if my instincts were wrong and I was chasing the wrong person, or if he had the bag wrapped tightly around him making it impossible for me to grab the bag without getting into a tug-of-war with that man. How would we get back home without our passports or IDs? How would we be able to eat or pay for a home without our credit/debit cards/cash? How would we be able to contact our families or friends for help if we lost both our phones? How would we prove to the authorities who we were if we didn’t have anything to show?</p>
          <p>I kept blaming myself for the incident. I kept thinking about how stupid I was for taking my eyes and hands away from my bag even for just a second. For someone who grew up in a third world country that’s infested with thieves, I should have seen the red flags. I felt stupid and angry that I got us in that predicament but I was also extremely thankful that we were safe and that we were able to recover everything right away.</p>
          <p>Our train to Berlin had reached the station. And though I felt slightly safer inside the train, I still had that strange feeling that we were being watched. I stayed up all throughout the journey until we reached our destination. I knew there was going to be more of them out there but I was now vigilant. It was a reminder that you should never let your guard down when you’re in an unfamiliar place.</p>
