    <p>About a year ago, my sister gave birth to a cute little boy named Nathan. Everyone in the family gathered to see the little boy as he slept in his yellow-and-brown crib. At about a few days old, the little boy already had tons of facial expression.</p>

    <p>The size of his little foot compared to my finger. So tiny, I wanted to pinch it.</p>

        <p>Fast-forward, this is about 2 months ago. He’s all big and has teeth already. Nathan still surprised us with new facial expressions. I guess that’s how he communicates with us.</p>

    <p>One of the cutest expression–the shocked look. He would do this for a few seconds.</p>

        <p>Looking up at his auntie, who’s taking too many photos of him. Sorry Nathan, I can’t resist taking photos of you.</p>

    <p>Can’t wait to see you tonight, little one.</p>
