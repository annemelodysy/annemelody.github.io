    <p>It's 2018 and here I am reflecting on the previous year and what it has taught me. I usually write my private thoughts on a small notebook I hide under my bed but this year, I thought I'd try something different. Instead of keeping my thoughts to myself, maybe I should try to be honest with myself and share them here. I have no idea what consequences or effects this will have but I like surprises. I'm turning 30 this year anyway so I'm close to not giving a fuck about anything. Here are a few things I learned from last year:</p>
    <h3>Losing friends is not something to be sad about</h3>
    <p>It's totally okay to just have a handful of friends. There are people that I used to be closer to that I no longer hangout or interact with. I don't necessarily blame them because I'm aware that part of the reason is because I'm not giving them more attention than I should. There's no shame in losing friends. It happens as we get older and we understand ourselves better and what we are looking for in relationships.</p>
    <p>On the plus side, I've gained new friends that I'm starting to feel comfortable with. I don't easily trust people and I tend to have my guard up. I'm a very anxious person especially around other people but once I get past that, everything will just fall in to place.</p>
    <h3>It's okay to be irrelevant</h3>
    <p>In an age where people value followers and likes, it's hard to avoid wanting the same things. I mean, it's one way to quantify your impact on people right? Who doesn't like seeing a quantifiable proof of your worth? Admittedly, there had been many times in the past year when I feel disappointed in myself when few people interact with my photos yet they easily like a typical selfie with a hundred hashtags. I've cycled through thoughts of self-doubt and insecurity.</p>
    <p><i>Is it me? Do people not appreciate my work because they find me annoying? What have I done wrong?</i></p>
    <p>But after going through all those thoughts, I try to ask myself different questions.</p>
    <p><i>Do I really want a high following that are shallow? Or should I aim for quality over quantity. Have fewer but high quality people in my circle.</i></p>
    <p>Which brings me to the another thing I learned in 2017&mdash;</p>
    <h3>Don't ever compare yourself to other people</h3>
    <p>Again, with social media, it's so easy to see people succeed without learning the full context. It's so easy to forget that we only see a snippet of a person's life. They might make it look easy but there's a big chance they spent hours working towards their achievement.</p>
    <h3>Appreciate the little things</h3>
    <p>It sounds clich√© but this is one of the biggest things I learned in the last year. If I hadn't broken my leg, I wouldn't have noticed the good in people because I was so focused on the bad. The media shows us how evil people can be and even reading comments bring out the worst in people. But when I broke my leg and had a hard time getting around, I started to notice the little things that make people good like how they give up their seats or when something as simple as someone saying they hope you get better.</p>
    <p>I've also learned to appreciate Jeremie more. Of how patient he has been while I'm limping around so slowly, how patient he was when on our trip to Hawaii, he had to do extra things like dropping me off the entrance while he parks the car and then walking back to the parking area and picking me up again. How when I needed someone to lean on (literally), he never complains even though it's really hot and humid. How he doesn't mind that we could not do some of the gorgeous hikes because of my condition.</p>
    <h3>I enjoy creating photographs</h3>
    <p>I've never labeled myself as a photographer&mdash;ever. But in 2017, I realized how much I like taking photos as much as I thought I did. It has always been there, a constant habit. I've never really admitted to myself that I liked doing it because I've never reflected on how I really feel about it until now. And also, I'm not a technical photographer which I always thought as how you know someone likes what they're doing. I've always just did stuff because I feel a certain way when I am looking at my photos. But looking back, it has always been a constant in my life ever since I had access to our first film camera.</p>
    <h3>I am privileged</h3>
    <p>We are lucky to have a choice to either stay in this country or not. Not everyone gets to live here but even more, not a lot of Filipinos who come to the land of the free gets to have a choice to go back home. A lot of them have family to support and put all their hopes in becoming a US citizen, but we're lucky to have a decent place to come home to back in the Philippines if we ever decide to leave this country. I am lucky to have the option to not work in an office yet earn a decent income. I'm lucky to be able to live here and travel to places I used to only dream of. But I'm not here to brag about my privilege. I think that reflecting about this has helped me appreciate life more. It has made me want to give back to my country in some ways (I don't know how yet, but I've been thinking about this a lot lately).</p>
