    <p>What's in my head?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I wish to remove a few people from my social networks but do not have the courage to do it. I care too much about what people think and do not wish any drama to start brewing just because of that. I do not want them to have the last laugh but I swear that this should stop now.</li>
      <li>I've been telling myself that I should quit ranting online. It's stupid in my opinion. But I do not want to sound like a broken record offline and writing is the only way for me to scream.</li>

    <p>One day, I got into thinking about how strange humans are and how quickly they can transform into something completely unfamiliar. I know it isn't easy for an introvert to be around people however, it is necessary to interact to satisfy our social needs.</p>
    <p>I admit, I am not necessarily an easy person to be friends with. I am emotional. I am a cynic. I dislike a lot of things. But that does not mean I do not care about the people around me. I care about a handful of individuals.</p>
    <p>In my 23 years of life, I have met with 3 kinds of people:</p>
    <h3>The Permanent Dwellers</h3>
    <p>These are the people that know every inch of me despite the fact that I try to hide it from them. They know, without asking, how my day went or what has become of me despite the distance. These are people who support me despite knowing that I get a little too eccentric from time to time. They do not let the social norms affect their judgement. We argue at times, but it always end up with a hand shake.</p>
    <p>Sadly, there are only a handful of these people on earth. Thankfully though, I got a few of them with me.</p>
    <h3>The Hitch Hikers</h3>
    <p>These are the people who were only a part of my life for a brief moment. They start of as incredibly nice people but disappear as soon as they realize they have reached their destination and so we become strangers once more. These people should be avoided at all cost unless they intend to become permanent dwellers. Note that not all hitch hikers are bad. In fact some of them leave a good impression in our lives.</p>
    <p>Some hitch hikers though are to be avoided. These people love it when you compliment them and listen to their stories but when it's time for you to say something, they just don't care. I have met with a bunch of people whom I thought knew me well but eventually turn their backs on me.</p>
    <p>These types of hitch hikers are hard to please and wait until they find a flaw in you.</p>
    <h3>The Borderline Occupants</h3>
    <p>The Borderline Occupants step in and step out into your life whenever they have to. They are neither good or bad, they're just there. You don't need to pretend or please them, they don't care. It's as if, their presence is that of a robot with neutral emotions, just doing what it was built to do. These people maybe those you encounter in coffee shops, or meet in a rest room. Bumping into them for countless times may allow them to transform into either a hitch hiker or a permanent occupant.</p>
    <p>I am too young to decide that people fall into these 3 categories. Life is still a long way ahead of me and I have yet to discover new kinds of humans.</p>
