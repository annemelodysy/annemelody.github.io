    <p>So it began, an unusual love story that led to the merging of two happy souls. If you're curious, you can read about how they met and fell in love <a title="Yellow Mohawk Dreams" href="http://yellowmohawkdreams.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Jeremie helped in making this geeky and cute website for the couple.</p>
    <p>We started our evening in Manila with a drink that ended quite early because I was starting to feel really sleepy. I have very very low tolerance to alcohol and one or two glasses of Mojitos can knock me down. My company however, remained calm.</p>

    <p>Here’s where we had drinks at Resorts World Manila just a few minutes from the airport.</p>

    <p>My drunk-ass face proves that I shouldn’t drink more than 1 glass of alcohol at a time.</p>

    <p>Waking up the next day was a chore and we almost got lost. Luckily, the wedding did not start yet when we arrived at Paco Park. Here’s a photo of St. Pancratius Chapel where the wedding was held. It’s a very lovely place. Jeremie and I recall walking around this area during a previous trip. We unintentionally got lost while looking for a bookstore on foot.</p>

    <p>The indoor lighting. Very lovely indeed. I like the fact that the place was not very big. It felt really intimate and romantic. This is one of those moments when I wish I had a wide-angle lens that could capture how the chapel looked like from the inside.</p>

    <p>The couple and their very lovely kiss. You could really tell that these two are so in love just by looking at the picture. There were a bunch of photographers in front of me but I managed to squint into the tiny holes and took a quick shot.</p>

    <p>I just love it when the bride and groom become a bit more creative with their outfit. Here's an example of Franz looking like a rockstar. Spikey shoes, spikey suit.</p>

    <p>Off to the reception at Sofitel Hotel. The hotel looked very classy like one of those 50's or 60's theme you'd see on the television. I wasn't able to take some photos though.</p>

    <p>Jeremie's suit. It's too bad he decided to go with the leather shoes instead of the desaturated-orange sneakers. hehe</p>

    <p>Last minute dress I bought on Thursday. I did my own makeup by the way. I really need practice. I still don't know how to apply eyeshadow and that eyebrow thing. Total noob. :p</p>
    <img src="/assets/2012/allan-and-joed/14.jpg"  />
    <p>Not so nicely done nails. I guess this just shows that I use my hands a lot--taking photos, eating, rummaging through my bag. My nail polish just won't survive long.</p>

    <p>Cute photobooth shot. I love the caption!</p>

    <p>This was one of my favorite part of the wedding. Instead of the usual wine toast, they decided to go with a chocolate shot. It was extremely delicious I wanted to have more toasts.</p>

    <p>Highlight was definitely the food. It was one of the most awaited moments of the wedding since these two have really good taste in food. Each bite was heaven!</p>

    <p>The groom dancing for the bride. It was hilarious.</p>

    <p>Here's Jeremie acting loopy with his workmates while waiting for the evening cocktails.</p>

    <p>Me and the girls. :)</p>

    <p>The cocktail event that led to more surprises and scrumptious food.</p>
    <img src="/assets/2012/allan-and-joed/24.jpg"  />
    <p>nom nom nom nom. I forgot that I was wearing a dress and makeup while eating this.</p>

    <p>Two celebrities Ramon Bautista and Tado hosting the wedding.</p>

    <p>Everyone seemed to have enjoyed the wedding. I got tipsy again though because of the drinking/trivia game so we went home earlier than everyone else. Four shots of Vodka and I just wanted to go home and sleep.</p>
    <img src="/assets/2012/allan-and-joed/27.jpg"  />
    <p>The next day, we were at Greenbelt so we decided to try Happy Lemon. I've been reading a lot of blogs about it and got really curious about their milktea.</p>
    <img src="/assets/2012/allan-and-joed/28.jpg"  />
    <p>We tried the chocolate with rock salt and cheese instead. Was it good? All I can say is, nothing can replace the dark chocolate milktea with rock salt and cheese at good ol' <a title="Bubble Tea Station" href="http://www.facebook.com/bubbleteastation?fref=ts" target="_blank">Bubble Tea Station</a> in BTC back in Cebu. ;)</p>
    <img src="/assets/2012/allan-and-joed/29.jpg"  />
    <p>We couldn't go home without buying our favorite chocolate. We looove Royce' Potatochip Chocolate sooo much that we don't mind paying the price (₱580.00). Our wallets might have died, but our stomachs are definitely happy.</p>
