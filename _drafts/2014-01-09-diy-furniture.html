    <p>When I set my mind on something, I do everything I can to get it. I am like a spoiled kid who just can't sleep until she gets that toy she's been eyeing on for days. The only difference is that I do it myself instead of asking other people to get it. The only times I allow other people to get it for me is when they offer it.</p>
    <p>Like when I was a kid, I loved collecting Polly Pockets. Obviously I couldn't afford them then so my parents gave me a challenge. They said that they would buy me a Polly Pocket every time I get a place in the top 3 honor roll in class. Fortunately, this was in the 3rd grade when I got transferred to another section (instead of being in the 1st section). I studied so hard that I was able to achieve the goal. I got my Polly Pockets and was a fairly happy kid.</p>
    <p>Years later, I had this urge to try living on my own. I felt like this was something I should try before turning 30. I guess you would say I'm that sort of person who likes to experience things as much as she can.</p>
    <p>So when I decided it was time for me to move out and live in an apartment, I had my mind set to it completely. First, I had to consider the budget, then the place, then reconsider the budget again, and the cycle goes on.</p>
    <p>I finally found a bare apartment I could customize and that also fits the budget. Now for some makeover. Unfortunately, I am super picky so it's kind of hard to get something that I want without having to compromise a little. Kind of like when I go shopping and I spend an entire day at the mall and find just 1 or 2 things that I like. It might just be me or it has something to do with the very little available choices in Cebu.</p>

    <p>The studio unit with its default not-so-nice-looking vinyl floor. By the way, the walls were beige so I decided to repaint it white to make the room look bigger. Light colors especially white give extra space to your narrow room.</p>

    <p>Here's how the floor looked after replacing the tiles.</p>
    <p>Furniture Time! It's hard to find a good furniture store in Cebu (I'm sure there's a few out there but not exactly my taste) so I decided to go the other route. Instead of buying furniture, I went with custom-made.</p>
    <p>After several visits to <em>known</em> furniture shops, I found a small store in Parkmall(now in Ayala new wing) that caught my fancy. <em>Projekt</em> specialized in small apartments and they seemed to have better taste than most shops <em>in</em> Cebu. When I learned that they also customize furniture, I was ecstatic. The search was finally over.</p>
    <p>Taking a leap and trusting on my instinct, I sent them some pictures of the furniture I liked as reference since I had a hard time describing exactly what I wanted. Luckily, they were able to make it look similar.</p>
    <p>Here's a comparison of the pictures I sent vs the actual furniture. Now, I can't seem to remember where I got some of the reference photos so I apologize ahead to the people who took these lovely shots. Anyway, I do not claim any ownership to both design and photos. I'll try my best to remember where I stumbled upon them but my memory isn't my best asset.</p>

    <p>I am not a fan of headboards. My idea of a good furniture is one that is very minimal and simple. <em>* Disclaimer: The photo above is not mine</em></p>
    <img src="/assets/2014/diy-furniture/4.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>Ta-da! Here's the result.</p>

    <p>I wanted a workstation that did not take too much space. I stumbled upon this wall-mounted desk and fell in-love immediately. The result is the photo on the right. It gives you plenty of space plus the colors of the room even resembled my unit. Perfect! <em>* Disclaimer: Photo on the left is not mine.</em></p>

    <p>We all know <em>Ikea</em> has good taste. But since they're not in Cebu yet (though I feel they're coming soon), I decided to make my closet look like the photo above but with slight modifications. <em>* Disclaimer: Photo by Ikea</em></p>

    <p>Here's how mine turned out. I added a place where I could hang my clothes. Forgive the mess.</p>

    <p>My cupboards were inspired by one of the model furniture in <em>Projekt's</em> boutique. Except I changed the glass shelves to just wood and removed the lighting. Note: It was cleaning day when I took photo on the right.</p>

    <p>My dining table and chairs for two. My tiny apartment could only fit 2 chairs. <em>* Disclaimer: Left photo by Ikea</em></p>

    <p>Roman Shades. I've been looking around Cebu for a company that could make Roman Shades but to no avail. I was about to give up and just have them made in Manila until I stumbled upon a very small store in Ramos called <em>Curtains Unlimited</em> (opposite of Velez) that knew how to make one. It was just perfect. The service was very good too.</p>

    <p>And here's how it looks like with all the custom-made furniture. It now feels cozier and looks spacious.</p>
    <h2>Some Tips for the Do-it-Yourselfer:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom-made furniture can sometimes be cheaper than commercialized ones. Considering good quality, in my experience it's easier to resell custom-made ones.</li>
      <li>You don't have to spend too much to get a good item. You'd be surprised to find some super cheap yet decent things in White Gold such as this lovely stool.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Another good find in White Gold. Pretentious, no?</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Containers and baskets are very handy for organizing things. Nothing beats sleeping in a well-organized apartment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Baskets bought in Rustan's. Also try checking Muji for more baskets like these.</p>

    <p>Here's another idea for storing shoes. I bought these really cheap shoe storage in <em>Ikea</em>. They are stackable and very lightweight. I even place my wet umbrella in one of the shelves.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take Advantage of promotions and sales. I bought most of my other things like the mattress, pillows, sheets, vacuum, induction cooker during SM's big sale. I think I only paid 50%-70% of the actual price!</li>
      <li>Lastly, take good care of your furniture. I was able to get back most of what I spent on my furniture because they looked brand new even after several months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Side note</strong>: spend on experiences not just things. I kept my apartment minimal and bought only things I needed because the fun part was the experience of living in one.</p>
