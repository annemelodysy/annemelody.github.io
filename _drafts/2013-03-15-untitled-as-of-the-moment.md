The obsession began that night as I sat in my car, parked in a random corner, 20 minutes away from my apartment. I remember how bright the sky looked that evening. The moon shaped round and perfectly, glowing yellow in front of my windshield. I slide the window down a couple of inches to let air in. Stroking my hair with one hand, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the window. Two scruffy, hazel eyes stare back, looking tired as hell.

Last night took most of me. I don't recall the last time my father came over to my place, but he seemed obligated to visit. Our conversation hovered over awkward single sentences as I forced stale leftovers down my throat.

At the corner of my eye, I saw him open his mouth, but pause for a second then continued eating a large chunk of meat. Every now and then, he would look at the empty walls of my apartment as he shook his head in silent disappointment.

"Son, I need you to come home." Those words floated in my head as I sat uneasily behind the driver’s seat.

The clock flashed 10:33. Just as I looked out the window, I caught a glimpse of a figure moving in the shadows. She stopped to take a breath under a lamp post, staring blankly ahead. It was then that I saw her profile, the outline of her hair glimmered under the moonlight. Her wavy, short hair tucked behind her ears.

The light captured her face perfectly, it revealed a blank expression showing. She was wearing a dress in such a cold evening. I made an assumption that she had just left a party.

She turned her head towards me. I’m not exactly sure if she saw me hiding in the shadows, but she looked straight at me, flashed a smirk, and then left. The image followed me for the rest of the night as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling. I replayed that hint of a smile over and over. Every detail&mdash;the shadow cast from the flickering light above her, the faint blow of the wind whisking her hair, the slow and playful movement of her lips as they slightly pulled towards the corner of her cheek.

&mdash;

The next day, I woke up from a dream I couldn't remember. The sun found its way inside my window, casting a triangular glow over my bed.

I went into the kitchen. The plates were still in the sink, proof that last night happened&mdash;my father's visit, me driving off, and the girl...

Did she catch me looking at her last night? Shit.

I walked back to my room. The view from my window showed a slow-moving traffic and a group of people crossing the street. Opposite to my apartment, there were several windows open and one that had a broken planter.

My laptop woke up as I opened it and started browsing through some photos. I worked as a photographer for a local magazine, taking pictures of people’s houses for a living. The thing about shooting inanimate objects is that you are not obligated to talk to them. They just lie perfectly still and let you do your work. They have many stories to tell without uttering a word.

The phone rang. I picked it up and it’s the office telling me that I had a couple of new projects. Two houses&mdash;one on the upper side of town and the other a few blocks from my apartment. Since I didn’t feel like doing much that day, I decided to work on the nearest one first.

"Why don’t you take pictures of people?" Gary puts down his bottle of beer on the table. It was suddenly Friday night and we were celebrating his latest success of running an advertising firm that was generating more than it had in its first quarter.

"I just don’t."

"Is this some sort of rebellious-artist-thing you’re doing?"

"What do you mean by rebellious-artist-thing exactly?"

"You know, the kind of people who do their own thing because they don’t like being told to do things. Avoiding something, you know. You get what I mean Levi."

"I just prefer houses. What’s wrong with that?"

"Nothing. Let’s leave it at that. Maybe you just haven’t met the right girl to take photos of."

I smiled wryly, and in a blink of an eye, she’s back in my head flashing that mischievous smirk.

"Listen, don’t you think it’s time you settled with someone Levi?"

"That’s ironic coming from a guy who’s dating two girls at the same time."

"Ouch, not cool." Gary raises his bottle gesturing for me to do the same. "Cheers to a good life."

"I still think you’re being unfair to Amy," I mutter after taking a quick sip from my bottle.

"Okay, okay I’m no saint, but I’m not married so what's wrong with that?"

"That's a stupid argument."

Gary laughs shaking his head sideways. I gave up pestering him for the rest of the night. There was no point in arguing with a man convinced of his ideas of how to live life. Who was I to judge him? I wasn’t a saint either. Not that I’d date two girls at the same time. I’ve never even really been in a serious relationship as far as I can remember.

There was this girl in college&mdash;Lena. Very attractive, the kind of girl who kept her dark hair wrapped in a ponytail and bangs that hang above her eyes. She had beautiful round eyes that looked at you intently. I saw her looking at me in class and I never really gave it much thought until she approached me one day after class and gave me her number. For some time, I considered calling her but ended up losing it intentionally. Don’t get me wrong, she was beautiful, but I wasn’t sure there was anything I could do to keep her around.

Eventually, she asked me out herself. I never understood what she saw in me, but I decided to give it a try. She was easy to talk to and laughed at all my absurd attempt at joking. She mostly did the talking, but I was happy with that. I liked listening to her laugh every time she thought of something funny to say.

In the end, it didn’t work out well. We realized we had nothing in common and I was too tired to work on our relationship. It was mostly my fault because I couldn’t do the things she wanted me to do like meet her parents. She broke up with me and ended up dating Gary&mdash;who was, then, a classmate. He seemed like the guy who had everything figured out&mdash;even women.

Then came Mika. She was sweet, shy, and cute. Unlike Lena, she wore her hair short. We were mostly quiet when we hanged out, but our moments alone were intimate. But a couple of months later, it didn’t work out either.

I decided to stop dating altogether. It wasn’t that bad. I had no interest in committing to something unstable. I had yet to figure out how humans work, so for the meantime, I’m focusing my energy on making sure there are clients coming in every few weeks or so.

Finishing my bottle of beer, I left Gary and found myself back in bed staring at the white ceiling. My last thought before drifting into sleep was if I’d see her again.
