They say that admitting is the first step to recovery. This doesn't always make sense to me but here goes: I admit that I have commitment issues. Yes, I'm ashamed of labeling myself as a person with a thousand ideas and starts things without finishing anything.

Before I go on, let me clarify one thing. No, this is not what you think it is. I'm not talking about my relationships&mdash;romantic or otherwise. I'm talking about things that I want to do in life. One minute, I'm "passionate" about writing, the next I find myself staring blankly at x number of stories that I've started and forgotten.

This morning I told myself that I would continue working on this story that I wrote a few days back, but I got lazy again. The story is about the idea of being too comfortable and the protagonist's realization that comfort isn't always a good thing. But alas, the laziness has taken over and won. Lazy-ass - 99, Melody - 0.
