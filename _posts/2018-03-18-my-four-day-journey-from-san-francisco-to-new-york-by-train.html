    <p>When Jeremie said he had to fly to New York for work, I instantly jumped at the opportunity. Who doesn’t love NYC? The art scene and food is just phenomenal, and the things you see on the streets…perfect opportunity for me to practice what I’ve learned in my <i>Exploring composition</i> class.</p>
    <p>It was a spontaneous idea driven by my curiosity to try something different. On our last two trips to New York, we always took a plane but this time, I thought maybe I’d try a different route. I read an article about a guy who took the train from San Francisco to New York with a low budget and that sparked my interest. After all, I’m not in any hurry and I’ve always wanted to travel from coast to coast the old-fashioned way.</p>
    <p>I booked a one way train ticket for about $232. Good deal but what was I getting myself into? Maybe I hadn't thought about this hard enough. First, the trip was going to be approximately 80 hours or roughly 4 days! And second, I was going to take this trip alone which means I either had to endure isolating myself in my seat or interact with random strangers for 4 straight days. Both of which makes me anxious.</p>
    <p>I managed to convince myself eventually that this was a great opportunity to push myself into doing something brave. Sure, I’ve taken train rides alone in <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/the-train-to-kanchanaburi" target="_blank">Thailand</a> and <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/the-people-you-meet-along-the-way" target="_blank">Indonesia</a> in the past few years, but none of them took days to reach my destination. Fortunately, I booked the ticket a week before the trip so I had no room to overthink the situation and doubt myself.</p>

    <h3>Beginning of the journey</h3>
    <p>The trip started in San Francisco’s Transbay Terminal where an Amtrak bus took us to Emeryville. This is where the California Zephyr train departs. The terminal was smaller than I imagined, there's a small snack bar where you can buy last-minute snacks.</p>
    <p>After a 30-minute delay, our train finally arrived. People who booked a room were moved to one side of the platform while the rest of us <s>poor</s> coach people were asked to stand on one area. The coach section of the train (similar to an airplane's economy class) had two levels.</p>
    <p>Basically, the only difference is that you get better views on the upper deck and connect to the observation car while the lower deck had easier access to the restrooms. I obviously opted for the top deck knowing I'll be taking in the views rather than use the restroom. FYI, restrooms start clean but degrade over the next few days. Okay, it was nasty! And coach folks don't get to take a bath so there's that too.</p>
    <p>"All aboard!" the conductor announced and we were off.</p>

    <h3>Looking through the panoramic glass</h3>
    <p>The main reason why I opted to take the train was that they boasted excellent views of the most scenic landscapes of the country. The California Zephyr has an observation car with panoramic glass windows that give you wide views of the passing scenery. After the conductor checks your ticket, you can head over to the observation deck.</p>
    <p>There wasn't a lot to see in the bay area&mdash;the train runs close to the water and you see mostly small farms, hills, and factories. I didn't bother to take pictures and spent the time slowly eating my sandwich and catching up with work emails.</p>
    <p>When we got to Sacramento, more people boarded the train as well as a local guide who shared some history of the places we passed by.</p>

    <p>Moments later, the terrain shifted from winter wonderland to barren desert. If you blink for a second, you get transported to a different world and at a different time. It was getting late but I didn't even realize I spent the entire day staring outside the window and not doing anything at all. I didn't realize it then but it was almost like meditating.</p>

    <p>We had reached Colorado by noon. I always thought Colorado would be fully covered in snow but I guess I was wrong. In some parts, it looked very similar to Utah's landscape.</p>
    <p>At some point, I made a conscious decision to put my camera away so I could be more present. This explains why I don't have a lot of photos in this part of the trip. I get so caught up with taking photographs that I sometimes forget to just appreciate the beauty of this planet.</p>
    <p>The route from Nevada - Utah - Colorado was probably my favorite part of the entire journey. It felt like being in a completely different world. You feel so tiny compared to the world outside.</p>

    <p>Our train was way behind schedule so it took us longer to reach Chicago on day 3. I had plans to walk around the city before transferring to the next train (Lake Shore) that traveled straight to New York but I only had 3 hours instead of the original 6 hours stopover. My mission was to have dinner in Nando's Peri-peri chicken (the best!!!), buy some Garrett cheese popcorn then run back to the station. I made it just in time before the Lake Shore train started boarding passengers.</p>

    <h3>People and conversations</h3>
    <p>I love listening to people's stories. I think it allows you to see a glimpse of someone's life much like a photograph. But I'm not good with strangers. It's not that I'm afraid of what they would think of me. Honestly, it's just that I get uncomfortable with small talk. I prefer going straight to deeper conversations. However, with strangers you obviously need to start somewhere before going deep. And that is what makes me anxious.</p>
    <p>I gathered my strength and forced myself to go past the anxiety. Some never went past small talk, but others quickly moved to something deeper. I noticed that it was easier to talk to people who exposed their vulnerabilities. I had stronger connections with them.</p>
    <p>I encountered so many different kinds of characters on the train: the man who only talked about work, the optimistic young lady who left her home so she could train to become a Shaman in New Orleans, the early 20s guy who grew up in a dysfunctional environment and almost ended up in prison if not for his son who inspired him to become a better person, the adventurous old lady who has taken the cross-country train three times, the middle-aged man who quit alcohol and was proud to have been sober for 10 years, the middle-aged woman who has not quit alcohol but is absolutely fine with that.</p>

    <p>I met Mr D. on the first morning as we traversed Utah. He saw me fiddling with my camera and asked what kind of camera it was. He told me he dreamed of becoming a photographer and even went to college for it but because of financial reasons, he ended up working on the train to support his family. He gave me a few tips on which side of the train to sit to get better views. He was also nice enough to let me practice taking portraits of him. I think I could've done better with the output but I didn't want to keep him from doing his job.</p>

    <h3>Dining</h3>
    <p>The antique-looking dining car is one of the highlights of the train experience. It looked like you stepped into a scene from a Wes Anderson movie. The food wasn't that good (IMO) but you get to meet different people. They had a system where the staff assigns you to a seat so that you get seated with random people every time. The food prices are a bit steep but you have an option to order at the snack bar instead where food is more affordable.</p>
    <p>On some occasions when I didn't feel like interacting with people, I simply went down to the snack bar, got myself a hotdog or a pizza and ate at my seat. Some people even brought their own food which they stored in a cooler. The food at the snack bar was...meh but worth the price you pay. Also, they have water available in the coach cars but I didn't like how it tasted so I spent a few bucks on bottled water.</p>

    <h3>Sleeping in coach</h3>
    <p>My seat was bigger than a standard plane seat and it had a lot of space for my feet. You can recline the seat and not have to worry about the person behind you because of all the space. I also noticed that since it wasn't peak season, there were a lot of empty seats so we got to take two seats instead of one!</p>
    <p>Essentials:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pillow. They don't provide this for free. You can purchase one though.</li>
      <li>Blanket. Same.</li>
      <li>Eye mask. Lights out at 10pm but if you're like me and you like sleeping in complete darkness then this is important.</li>
      <li>Ear plugs. I wish I brought a pair with me. The man behind my seat kept listening to some sort of propaganda the whole two nights I was on the train. I know I should've confronted him but I didn't have the guts.</li>

    <p>I had a hard time sleeping at night despite having all that space. All the lights had to be turned off at 10pm but you can't stop people from walking back and forth on the aisle. As a light sleeper and unreasonably paranoid person, my eye mask wasn't enough to get me to sleep.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, I slept better during the day. Not sure why, but maybe I was just too exhausted that my brain just shut off on its own.</p>

    <h3>Human lives are more important</h3>
    <p>Not so fun fact: cows who stray near the train tracks are run over to save human lives. I found out from one of the conductors that if you feel a bump while on the train, there's a chance that means they have run over a cow. Apparently it happens everyday and they'd rather hit a cow than derail the train and cause more damage. Poor cows. 😢</p>

    <h3>Border patrol</h3>
    <p>The last part of my trip was spending the night on the Lake Shore train from Chicago to New York. At this point, there was nothing visually interesting outside the window unless you're interested in dead trees, small houses, and unlimited snow.</p>
    <p>On one of the stops, I think it was in Syracuse, a few men in green uniform with the words "Border Patrol" written on them stepped inside the train.</p>
    <p>It was so weird. They seemed to be asking a few people (mostly people of color) if they were citizens and if they had paperwork to prove this. Occasionally, they'd ask a white person jokingly and almost rhetorically but do not wait for answers before moving on. At one point they pulled an Asian guy (who didn't seem to speak english) out of his seat and get him off the train. It made me so uncomfortable to see that the border patrol guy was holding his gun as if expecting trouble. I looked around the train and everyone seemed to not be bothered by this.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until we started moving again that the whole event sunk in my head. What if they asked me? Sure, I was in the country legally with a valid visa but I was not bring my passport on this trip. It was only a local trip after all and I had gone to New York twice with only my California driver's license. I thought about what would've happened if they thought my license wasn't sufficient enough to prove my status. Would they have kicked me out too?</p>
    <p>Later on, I read about it and apparently border patrol agents have authority to perform random checks on anyone they deemed suspicious within a 100 mile radius from any border. You can legally refuse to answer them but obviously that creates more suspicions. I'm not sure how I feel yet about this experience except that it felt weird.</p>

    <h3>Being alone</h3>
    <p>While everyone was asleep, I snuck out of my makeshift bed and went straight to the observation car. I was alone. I took a seat facing the window and put my headphones on. I had <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/annemelodysy/playlist/65y1EzOqHtPvff9MPmFV9B?si=SmhM-EWDQHmTSVZItPBwCg" target="_blank">curated a playlist</a> before my trip and listened to it as we cut through Utah's valleys.</p>
    <p>I can't remember the last time I was that emotional. I've seen many beautiful landscapes while traveling the country but this was different. We were moving at a steady pace and I was completely alone with my thoughts. It literally felt like being in a dream. I was floating, I was in a trance.</p>

In my previous trips in Asia, everyone seemed concerned that I was traveling alone and asked where my boyfriend/husband was. So I prepared myself with answers in case someone asked. I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a big deal.</p>
    <p>What's great about being alone is that people seemed to approach me more than when I wasn't. And they seemed eager to share their stories. It's almost as if the train is a sort of confession booth where people step in to share their deepest thoughts to a complete stranger before they get off at the next stop.</p>

    <p>I reached New York City late Thursday evening. The staff played Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York" on the speakers as we approached Penn station. My short journey had ended and I was excited to finally be able to take a shower!</p>
