    <p>Decisions have to be made.</p>
    <p>Should I stay within my comfort zone or step out of it and possibly live a thrilling life? I’ve never been the type to go beyond that invisible yellow line, but I think it’s time to tiptoe across and face the unknown. The challenge now is where to begin. After much thought, I made a list of things to guide me in accomplishing this new direction.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Try new food.</b> I'm not adventurous when it comes to food. I tend to hover over the familiar. It's a difficult task, but I need to take baby steps. Start with spicy food, maybe?</li>
      <li><b>Talk to people.</b> I'm paranoid, and in my head, I see strangers chasing me with a knife as I approach them. It must be the result of watching too many horror movies.</li>
      <li><b>Travel alone.</b> It's something I’ve wanted to do for so long. I keep putting up excuses not to do it. It's time to be brave and do it at least once.</li>
      <li><b>Take photos of people.</b> It's so hard to approach strangers, but I might be making a big deal out of nothing.</li>
      <li><b>Wear something interesting.</b> I need to find a particular style that suits me.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I’ll start with these five things and see what happens.</p>
