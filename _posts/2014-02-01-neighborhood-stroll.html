<p>I enjoy being on the streets because there's so much to see. Stories are formed as I take each step and they come in many scenarios. Every bit of brick, every motion or the lack thereof becomes something bigger than they are.</p>
<p>For instance, that rooftop that turned into a rendezvous where the cool birds love to sit and observe people. I listen to the crows making noises outside and I wonder what they are talking about.</p>
<p>And there's the manner in which people expose their routine in public. Two pairs of yellow boots hang upside down on a makeshift wooden boot-dryer.</p>
<p>Or the cracks and holes that reveal new life growing in it.</p>
<p>And don't forget the things that people leave behind.</p>
<p>And the shadows that imprint themselves on our streets creating preview to a parallel world.</p>
<p>All these make me want to just take a walk until my feet hurt and my camera running out of space for new pictures.</p>
