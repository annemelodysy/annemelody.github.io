    <p>I enjoy being on the streets because there's so much to see. Stories form as I take each step projecting themselves in different ways. Every brick, every motion or the lack thereof becomes more significant than they are.</p>
    <p>For instance, a rooftop that turned into a rendezvous where the cool birds gather and observe people. I listen to the crows making noises outside and wonder what they are on about.</p>
    <p>And there's the manner in which people expose their routine in public. Two pairs of yellow boots hang upside down on a makeshift wooden boot-dryer.</p>
    <p>Or the cracks and holes that reveal new life growing in it.</p>
    <p>And don't forget the things that people leave behind.</p>
    <p>And the shadows that imprint themselves on our streets creating a preview to a parallel world.</p>
    <p>All these make me want to take a walk until my feet hurt and my camera runs out of space.</p>
