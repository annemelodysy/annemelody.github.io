    <p>My 2016 was about creating new opportunities and facing fears. Of becoming bolder and opening to new things that I never thought I'd do. It was also about meeting new people and being with family and old friends.</p>
    <h3>January</h3>
    <p><i>Wedding anniversary</i>. To celebrate our first year of being married, Jeremie and I went to Iceland in December and ended our trip in Rome in early January.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="feb" class="section">
    <h3>February</h3>
    <p><i>Maryland</i>. It was my first time flying alone to the other side of the country. I went there to attend a friend's wedding which turned into a mini reunion with my highschool classmates.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="mar" class="section">
    <h3>March</h3>
    <p><i>New home</i>. Moved to a new home and upgraded from a studio to a one-bedroom apartment. We were very lucky to find a more spacious place that cost 1/3 less than our first apartment. Hooray for Craigslist.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="apr" class="section">
    <h3>April</h3>
    <p><i>Seattle</i>. Two months after seeing my highschool friends, we met up once again. This time on the other side of the country.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="may" class="section">
    <h3>May</h3>
    <p><i>Back to the office</i>. Started my new job as a designer for a company in downtown SF. It was great to be around people again after working from home for three years. You learn so much from being around new people.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="jun" class="section">
    <h3>June</h3>
    <p><i>Muir Woods</i>. The best way to explore this country is by driving. And thanks to <i>Getaround</i>, it was easy for us to grab a car and drive all the way to Muir woods, two hours from the city.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="jul" class="section">
    <h3>July</h3>
    <p><i>Lake Tahoe</i>. For the fourth of July holiday, we rented a car and drove for about four hours to the lake. I remember watching movies or reading books about this place and we finally got to see it in person.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="aug" class="section">
    <h3>August</h3>
    <p><i>Bouldering</i>. It's no secret that I'm afraid of heights and I would never do anything like this but Jeremie convinced me, so I gave it a try. Then, I saw that I was less afraid of heights and was actually stronger than I thought. Months later, I'm still climbing I don't regret taking that first step.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="sep" class="section">
    <h3>September</h3>
    <p><i>New York, New York</i>! The city was surprisingly great. I'm suprised because I expected to be disappointed. I hear a lot of stories from people who've been there hating New York and saying it's too touristy and overrated. But our experience was actually pretty great. You just need to find the right neighborhood. I loved how diverse the art scene was compared to SF, I love how unique the locals are, and the food...I can't even...</p>
  </div>
  <div id="oct" class="section">
    <h3>October</h3>
    <p><i>10-week UX course</i>. I've always been more curious about why people behave the way they do so I took this course to learn about how to conduct proper interviews, how to synthesize information, and create a solution from it. Plus, I met some cool, new people!</p>
  </div>
  <div id="nov" class="section">
    <h3>November</h3>
    <p><i>Canyons</i>. We flew to Las Vegas, met up with a couple of friends, drove to Utah, saw some amazing canyons, drove to Arizona, saw some more amazing canyons, slept in a cabin in the middle of nowhere owned by a Navajo Native American couple, drove to Yosemite where we were nervous about driving through a layer of snow, then drove back to SF. This was the longest drive we've done so far, jumping between 4 states.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="dec" class="section">
    <h3>December</h3>
    <p><i>Back home</i>. I saved up all my time-offs so we could come home for two weeks. So much has changed since we left almost two years ago--heavier traffic, more malls, a variety of cool shops. Yet, there's still that wonderful feeling of warmth in this little island. Oh, and the beaches are still awesome!</p>
