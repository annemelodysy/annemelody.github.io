  It was a terrible morning&mdash;as if the lack of sleep wasn't enough, the taxi driver who was supposed to take me to the train station took me to the wrong place! The hostel receptionist gave him instructions (in Thai), written on paper. But for some reason, there was a miscommunication.

  As soon as the taxi sped off, I realized that I didn't know where I was. Without knowing how to read/speak Thai, I started to get worried.

  I was eventually able to find an officer who helped me get another taxi. Since we were on the main highway, we had to wait several minutes to get one. He talked to the driver and made sure he understood the instructions.

  I thanked him profusely, amazed at the extreme kindness the Thai people had shown me over the past few days.

  Kanchanaburi at last. I spent some time walking around town and in the evening rewarded my feet with the most spine-tingling massage ever. My feet were pretty happy all thanks to these ladies. What a way to end the day.
