    <p>The wait is finally over. Here I am, a day before the big move, sorting through a pile of books. I've narrowed down to six favorites! It took ages for me to make decisions. Compare that to the time I spent on my clothes, which only took me five minutes to sort through.</p>
    <p>I can't wait to see Jeremie who's already in San Francisco. So long FaceTime, hello real face! And hello seventeen hours of flying! Yep, let's hope my books will keep me entertained.</p>
    <p>It sucks to be this far away from him, but I can't complain, we're both chasing our dreams. And I'm happy that he's finally in a place where he has more opportunities to achieve them. Sometimes you have to make small sacrifices to achieve bigger things. I hope we're both on the right track&mdash;with his passion for creating things, and my love for storytelling.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I'm double checking my things and making sure I've got everything ready. Tomorrow's the big day. See you again Cebu, and hello there San Francisco!</p>
