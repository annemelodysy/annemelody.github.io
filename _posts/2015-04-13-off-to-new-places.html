<p>All the wait is finally over. Here we are, a day before the big move and after carefully choosing from a pile of books, I've narrowed down to 6 favorites! It took me ages to decide which ones to bring and which ones to leave behind. Compare that to the number of minutes I spent on my clothes, which only amounts to about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can't wait to see Jeremie who is already there. So long Facetime, hello real face, and hello 17 hours of travel! Yep, let's hope my books will keep me entertained.</p>
<p>It sucks to be this far away from him but I can't complain...we're both chasing our dreams. And I'm happy that he's finally in a place where he has more opportunities of achieving that. Sometimes you have to make small sacrifices to achieve bigger things. And I hope we're both in the right track. Jeremie with his passion for building things, and me with my love for storytelling.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I'm double checking my things and making sure I've got everything ready. Tomorrow's the big day. See you again Cebu, and hello there San Francisco!</p>
