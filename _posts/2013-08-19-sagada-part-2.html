    <p>The next day started with a disappointment.</p>
    <p>We woke up at around 2 or 3 am and drove to a dark and misty uphill path. From all the photos we saw online, the place we were heading to was known for its magnificent sunrise view. Half-asleep in the van, I wondered about how the heck the tour/driver could navigate with a 2-meter visibility while climbing up a steep road.</p>
    <p>Jeremie and I were in the front seat talking to the guy about everything. We gathered that aside from giving tours, our well-versed driver also had his own bee farm. We talked about their culture and way of life. It felt like we were watching National Geographic or something.</p>

    <p>When we reached the top, we saw a couple of other vans parked. This was disappointment number 1. We really thought we had the place to ourselves but some folks had already arrived and started a bonfire.</p>

    <p>The place suddenly felt too crowded as soon as more vans arrived. It was getting really hard to move around without bumping into people.</p>

    <p>Disappointment number 2 came when we realized there was no sunrise. It was too cloudy. I bet we weren't the only ones disappointed.</p>

    <p>Our next destination was in an orange farm known for orange-picking. Unfortunately for us, they ran out of oranges for people to pick. Great.</p>
    <p>So we decided to just dropby the restaurant to eat breakfast.</p>

    <p>No sweat. We started like this and ended like fish out-of-water.</p>

    <p>Wait for me guys! I think I might get an award for slowest trekker. I have this huge fear of heights and this theory that my clumsiness will eventually kill me. Seriously dumb ways to die.</p>

    <p>We reached the waterfalls. We didn't swim though. We just looked at the crowd and headed back up.</p>

    <p>It was exhausting and surprisingly hot but we survived the walk.</p>
