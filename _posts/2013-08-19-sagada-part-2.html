excerpt:    We woke up at around 2 or 3 am and drove to a dark and misty uphill road.
intro: |
  The next day started with a disappointment.

  We woke up at around 2 or 3 am and drove to a dark and misty uphill road. From the photos we saw online, the mountain we were heading to was known for its magnificent sunrise view. I wondered about how the driver was able to navigate the steep hill with low visibility.

  Jeremie and I sat in the front seat and had a conversation with the driver. Other than the tours, he said that he had his own bee farm. We talked about their culture, beliefs, and way of life. He says that they practice animism and believe that spirits roam among us.

Disappointment number two came when we realized there was no sunrise. It was too cloudy. I bet we weren't the only ones disappointed.
