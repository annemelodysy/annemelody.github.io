<div class="grid grid-center width-half module">
  <p>The next day started with a disappointment.</p>
  <p>We woke up at around 2 or 3 am and drove to a dark and misty uphill road. From the photos we saw online, the mountain we were heading to was known for its magnificent sunrise view. I wondered about how the driver was able to navigate the steep hill with low visibility.</p>
  <p>Jeremie and I sat in the front seat and had a conversation with the driver. Other than the tours, he said that he had his own bee farm. We talked about their culture, beliefs, and way of life. He says that they practice animism and believe that spirits roam among us.</p>

  <p>When we reached the top, we saw a couple of other vans parked. This was disappointment number one. We thought we had the place to ourselves, but someone had already arrived and started a bonfire</p>

<div class="grid grid-center width-half module">
  <p>The place suddenly felt too crowded as soon as more vans arrived. It was getting really hard to move without bumping into people.</p>
  <p>Disappointment number two came when we realized there was no sunrise. It was too cloudy. I bet we weren't the only ones disappointed.</p>

  <p>Our next destination was in an orange farm known for orange-picking. Unfortunately for us, they ran out of oranges for people to pick. Great.</p>
  <p>Nothing seems to be going our way, so we decided to drop by a restaurant for breakfast.</p>
