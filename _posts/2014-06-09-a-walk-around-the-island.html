  <p>The earth was still wet from the night before, but the sky showed signs of a sunny morning.</p>
  <p><em>Good.</em> I thought to myself remembering yesterday's misadventure.</p>
  <p>I stumbled out of bed while grabbing my camera which was neatly placed next to my spectacles on the wooden table beside my bed. The road was empty except for a couple of people speeding off on their scooters.</p>
  <p>I heard a faint sound coming from one of the houses. Chanting. The neighbors were starting their day with a prayer, I presumed. In a way, it made my morning seem more magical.</p>

  <p>After several dead-ends and a failed attempt to go back to the guest house, I found myself on a white sand beach overlooking Mount Agung in the distance. I took a deep breath and thanked god I ended up on a pretty beach this time.</p>
  <p>I dipped my feet into the warm water and shuffled the sand as the fish scurried away. Ah! That felt good.</p>
  <p>There was a small pathway through the shallow water that led to the other side of the beach. No resorts or restaurants, just some overgrown grass.</p>

  <h3>The Invitation</h3>
  <p>When I returned to the guest house, my hosts asked me if I wanted to go with them to a birthday celebration. Intrigued, I nodded my head and sat at the back of Komang's pink scooter.</p>
  <p>On the way there, I made a short visit to a nearby attraction known as the Gala Gala Underground House. At first glance, it was what it was said to be. A house built below the ground resembling a cave. A priest built the house after being inspired by a Hindu epic. The Pandawas made a cave and lived in isolation after they were banished in the forest for gambling losses.</p>
  <p>The guide who took me around the cave said it was his father who built the underground house. I asked him if he had lived in the house too, but he just laughed and shrugged it off. Unsure of the meaning of his response, I decided to stop asking questions.</p>

  <h3>The Birthday Celebration</h3>
  <p>Komang wrapped me in a borrowed sarong before I entered the house. I quietly took a seat in a wooden chair and observed the other guests on the sideline.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Instead of balloons, cake, and candles, the place was full of offerings and incense.</li>
    <li>Instead of the usual Happy Birthday song, constant rhythmic chanting replaced it.</li>
    <li>Everyone wore a sarong except for the kids who ran around the house.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Believing that no one would notice me, I was startled when a lady carrying a baby approached me and asked where I was from.</p>
  <p>They shared about their life on the island and what they did for a living. It turns out that it was her baby who was having the party. I felt ashamed that I didn't even know who the celebrant was.</p>
  <p>She explained that they celebrated their birthday through a cycle based on their calendar. In the western calendar, the sequence occurs every six months. So technically, their birthdays happen more than once a year. I found this <a href="http://www.baliandbeyond.co.id/detailarticle-333-otonan-a-balinese-birthday.html" target="_blank">article</a> that explained the celebration well.</p>
