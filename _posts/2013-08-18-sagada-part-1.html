    <p>Lately, I've been posting throwback photos and blogs (this is one of them). There's a whole bunch of stuff I haven't gone through and posted yet due to some silly reasons. I guess it's my fault for keeping them in the backlog for so long.</p>
    <p>So the problem with blogging late is that a huge chunk of details gets lost and forgotten. Unless you've been gifted with good memory, this shouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, I have very poor memory so I usually rely on photos to remember.</p>

    <p>Sagada wasn't what I expected it to be. A few friends of mine thought our first trip together should be somewhere far from Cebu so it was decided we head out to Sagada, a little town up in the mountains of Luzon. The thing about having girls to travel with is that everything just seems easier (organizing, researching, planning).</p>
    <p>We took a bus from Manila to Baguio. We slept inside the bus for a good 8 hours (I think) before arriving in Baguio at dawn. We then took another bus from Baguio to Sagada once again sleeping in very tiny, cramped, uncomfortable seats.</p>

    <p>I was suddenly awakened by the glow of the sun emulating from outside the bus. I'm a pretty light sleeper so any change in the environment can trigger me to wake up. Feeling a little grumpy, I shifted my glance towards the side, facing the window.</p>
    <div class="block">

    </div>
    <p>The scene beyond me blew my mind completely. I suddenly felt so alive and lost interest in sleep. I stared outside for what seemed like hours feeding on the mist and moving mountains.</p>
    <div class="block">

    <p>During a stopover, I went down to grab some food. Jeremie looked like a sleeping kid and I couldn't help but smile. He just loves his sleep.</p>
    <div class="block">

    <p>He wasn't the only one still deep in sleep.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Over and over, I debated with myself whether what I saw in front of me was real or just some surreal dream that I'm having. The whole ride (though a bit uncomfortable) was such a treat for the eyes!</p>
    <div class="block">

    <p>That's me on the left with Loulou and Maiza. We went down the bus to stretch our sleeping legs for a bit.</p>

    <p>Eventually, we reached our destination. The town was surprisingly easy to navigate. Town hall even gave us a cute little map to help us move around with ease. We found our way towards our guest house. We received some confused stares as soon as we told the lady in front we had reservations. It turned out that they gave our room to someone else.</p>
    <p>We stood confused and angry and very very hungry.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, they told us they had an extra place where we could stay. We gladly accepted the offer not wanting to go through all the trouble of looking for another guest house. It seemed like a long walk (about 15 minutes or I might be exaggerating, I'm not so sure anymore) and we thought they were fooling with us but we ended up in a nice little private house a few meters from the main road.</p>

    <p>The house was literally made of wood--the exterior, the interior. The mishap suddenly turned into an advantage. We had the cozy house to ourselves and instead of sleeping in one room, we had three + a kitchen + a living room.</p>

    <p><strong>Shoes off!</strong> The floors were too clean for shoes. So we left ours by the door.</p>

    <p>After shower, we head out to a popular restaurant called "The Lemon Pie House" for lunch.</p>

    <p>We ordered warm milk tea. It tasted so good and fresh.</p>
    <div class="block">

    <p>Some artifacts that show the locals' culture. The guide that took us around even told us they don't allow outsiders to purchase their land because they wanted to preserve their culture.</p>

    <p>And obviously, they had pies for sale. The prices were a bit high (close to Manila rates) but I suppose it's because there are too many foreigners visiting the place.</p>

    <p>After a full meal, we head out for a walk. This guy went by and I couldn't help but wish I had a bike too.</p>

    <p>We decided to go ahead without a guide though it was sort of a stupid decision because we almost got lost in the woods. Luckily, we found a few hikers with a guide and we decided to follow them.</p>
    <div class="block">

    <p><strong>Dead end.</strong> This is what happens when you venture into unfamiliar land without a guide.</p>

    <p><strong>Hanging Graves</strong>. I couldn't get what the guide was saying so I can't tell you anything here. My mind gets distracted easily.</p>
    <div class="block">

    </div>
    <p>When it was apparent that the sun was retiring, we followed the guide and his group back to the main road. We had dinner and the night ended in a series of conversation and very little alcohol (Very little indeed. We're good kids).</p>
