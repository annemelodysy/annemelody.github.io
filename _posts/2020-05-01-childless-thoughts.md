I found this on my notes app this morning. It was written on May 2017, a year and a half before I turned 30. It's strange reading my own thoughts from the past, but it's also amusing. Like finding a stash of cash inside a book after forgetting about them.

This is unedited to preserve my thought process during that period in my life.

*May 22, 2017*

It's getting close&mdash;like a giant monster that's coming for me and that I can hardly escape. Where did all these thoughts come from? A year ago, I could care less about it.

I don't know what I want. I don't think I ever will. People keep saying, you don't need to be ready...once it hits you, you will absolutely fall in love with it. But the thing is, I'm not worried about that, I'm worried that I might not be able to do the things that make me happy because I have to be responsible of it. I'm worried I won't have time to read new books, travel places easily, or be lazy if I want to once I have it.

I feel like I'm already happy now and if that big change comes, I might regret it. Because I see no reason in making things unstable when you've only just discovered part of yourself and who knows what else you will discover about you. I see no reason in taking a leap that you're not even sure is something you might like when you could do something else that you're sure you enjoy.

But the thing is, I'm also curious. I see the benefit of having it&mdash;having an influence on another being sounds tempting. Having that capability of shaping someone's future...being needed. Seeing a part of you evolve into its own identity. The very concept of creation can be exciting.

Why can't we have everything we want at the same time? Why is it necessary to make a decision when you're not ready to make that decision? When you're still at your peak and want to maintain that.

I admit I am a little jealous of people who think in 1s and 0s. Who clearly believe in one specific goal in life and chase it. But that is not me. I am wired to want to explore and be curious of everything. I want to become something bigger than myself but I also want to feel what it feels to be small.

I'm almost 30 and either society or my own biological wiring is telling me it's time to have a child but my brain and heart wants to go on that big adventure. Discovering new places I've never been, seeing things I've never seen. It's really frustrating especially how the world has constantly reminded you about the "limitations" of the female body. And you wish it was just alternative facts but unfortunately it's not.

So I guess, to not be too whiny, I'll just list the choices I have now:

1. Freeze eggs and have a baby when you're ready in the future. Too expensive. Not 100% certain it will work.
2. Not have a kid. Have a corgi, be free of guilt when you travel.
3. Not have a kid but adopt once you are ready. The world is already filled with people. Lots of kids need love.
4. Have a kid, fall in love with it, but potentially regret not having enough time to do things you love.
5. Hope that technology will eventually allow humans to regenerate young cells so we don't have to worry about getting old eggs! So women can do both and not have to constantly be tormented with guilt or regret.

I think I like number 5. Now to start hoping this will become a reality in the near future. Hah!
