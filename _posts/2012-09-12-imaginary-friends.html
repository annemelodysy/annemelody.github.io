    <p>While drifting into the unknown world inside my head, a random thought came into my mind: Why didn't I have an imaginary friend as a kid? Or maybe I did but couldn't remember.</p>
    <p>As a child, I began to write and found comfort in it. I wrote my first story at the age of 9 in a tiny notebook that I keep hidden in my room. My imaginary friends were perhaps the characters I invented in my stories.</p>
    <p>Having an imaginary character to talk to would've been a great way to express all the emotions I held growing up. There's something strange yet fascinating about imaginary friends. It amazes me how kids can invent a character and give them life. I wonder what it would've been like to speak to a tree with human limbs or play with a bear who can fly.</p>
    <p>As I was in the middle of a thought, a question jumped. What kind of imaginary friend would the little me have? I decided to doodle it, thus the picture above. I've always been fond of sharks and read a lot of books about them. The kid me would've been ecstatic to have a shark-person as a friend. Of course, with a mustache, so it's cooler than the other sharks. I was a weak kid who cried too much and couldn't talk to people about my problems. I think a shark friend would have been the perfect friend I needed to protect me.</p>
    <p>Did you have an imaginary friend as a kid?</p>
