<p>While drifting off into the unknown world inside my head, a thought came randomly into my mind. Why didn't I have any imaginary friends as a kid?</p>
<p>Or perhaps I did have some but could not remember.</p>
<p>Having some made-up character to talk to would have been a good way to express all the emotions I felt growing up. But I wrote instead. I wrote my first story at the age of 9 in a tiny notebook that I still keep until now. My imaginary friends were perhaps the characters I created in my stories.</p>
<p>Either way, there's something strange yet interesting about imaginary friends. It amazes me how kids can simply create a character and bring them to life. I wonder how it would have been like to talk to a tree with human limbs. Or play with a bear who can fly.</p>
<p>As I was in the middle of thought, a question popped. What kind of imaginary friend would the little me have? Further thoughts, and I decided to doodle it, thus the picture above. I've always been fond of sharks and read a lot of books about them. The kid me would be ecstatic if she had a shark-person imaginary friend. Of course with a mustache to make him seem like he's cooler than the other sharks. I was a weak kid, I cried too much, I couldn't talk to people about my problems and kept them in, I think a shark friend would have been the bestfriend I needed to protect me.</p>
<p>What was your imaginary friend as a kid?</p>
