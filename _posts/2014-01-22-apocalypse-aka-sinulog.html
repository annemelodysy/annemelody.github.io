  Once a year, Cebuanos gather in the streets to enjoy a celebrated event called Sinulog. Students parade the street in costumes as they dance to the familiar beat that has played every year since I could remember.

  *Prii-ti-tit! Priii-ti-tiiit!*

  Locals recognize the festival as a celebration for Santo Ni√±o (Baby Jesus). But in recent years, it has evolved into a big party that tourists and young people alike take as an opportunity to have fun, go crazy, and get drunk. I take it as an opportunity to walk around the city without any fear of getting mugged. Of course, you do have to deal with gropers if you end up in the parts of the city where the parties are happening. So you're not completely safe.

  When it became dark, we began our hike to Ayala. Short distance, but the crowd was definitely a challenge.

  We ended our night with a spectacular fireworks display. It's been a while since I've experienced something like it. It was breathtaking!
