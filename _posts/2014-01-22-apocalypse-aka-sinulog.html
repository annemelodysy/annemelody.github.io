<p>Getting drunk and crazy? Nope, we didn't do any of those.</p>
<p>Apparently, people still go crazy during the annual <em>Sinulog</em> festival in Cebu. It's like having a full moon. I even saw a "werewolf" (see proof below).</p>
<p>Anyway, for the most part, I just walked around the city snapping random interesting things I came across. I mean this was probably the only time I could do that without fear of getting nabbed on the streets.</p>

<p class="mtop2">And we started our hike to Ayala. Short distance, but the crowd was definitely a challenge. I think I stepped on a few humans but I couldn't really tell.</p>

<p class="mtop2">Ended our night with a very spectacular fireworks display. Been awhile since I've seen something like this. It was breath-taking!</p>
