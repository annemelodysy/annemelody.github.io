excerpt:    Getting drunk and crazy? Nope, we did neither of those.
intro: |
  It's a thing for people to go crazy during the annual Sinulog festival in Cebu. It's like having a full moon. I even saw a "werewolf" (see proof below).

  For the most part, I walked around the city snapping random interesting things. I mean, this was probably the only time I could do that without fear of getting robbed.
