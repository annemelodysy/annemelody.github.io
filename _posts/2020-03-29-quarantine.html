  Hello world! It's day 13 since the official start of our shelter-in-place on this side of the world. Except for that one time I felt claustrophobic inside our 420 square foot apartment, I *think* I'm doing fine (physically + mentally). Working from home for 7 years and being an introvert has allowed me to adjust to situations like these. AND the internet helped too.

  My current productive state is the result of consuming caffeinated milk tea. Either of two things happen when caffeine enters my system: I become super anxious or extremely productive. Thank the universe my brain decides to go with the latter because I recently started taking a new medication and becoming anxious is one of its side effects. Fingers crossed I don't ever experience it.

  There's not much to see from where I am. We have a small garden, but we never really use it because our first floor neighbors have direct access to it and it feels like we're invading their space by being there.

  I thought about climbing that ladder up to our apartment's rooftop. But I think I'll save it for another day.
