  So why did I choose Alaska? I'm not exactly a big fan of cold weather and before I did some research, I had no idea what to expect. The only thing I knew about it is from watching this movie called <i>Into the Wild</i>. A man hitchhikes his way up to Alaska and isolates himself from society until he dies. Geez, I make it sound so depressing. Actually, it was a heartwarming, tragic film of a man living and connecting with nature. I won't say anything else in case anyone wants to see the movie or reads the book. It's non-fiction, which makes it even more interesting.

  And that's probably what made me want to visit Alaska&mdash;that I knew so little about it. Films give us a glimpse of places but often the way they are portrayed is over-romanticized. I wanted to see it for myself.

  From Anchorage, we rented a car and drove to nearby national parks. The one thing you notice while driving is that there are a TON of trees everywhere.

Apparently, they experienced the warmest day ever recorded which soared to about 77Â° Fahrenheit (About 25Â° Celsius). It doesn't seem that bad to us, but the change in temperature had consequences to this normally cool place.

  <h3>Seward and Kenai National Park</h3>
  We drove down to Seward where we saw <s>fishermen</s> fisherfolks(?) rinsing their gigantic fish! I am not a huge fan of cooked salmon (raw salmon is fine), but I admit, seeing them fresh from the water made me want to eat them.

Unfortunately, the darker algae absorbs more sunlight and causes the ice to melt even faster. ðŸ˜ž As we were watching the glacier, we heard a thundering sound that echoed throughout the distance. It was the glacier breaking. We were hundreds of meters away from the wall, but the sound was so loud, most of us on the boat were startled by it." %}
