excerpt:    Every few feet, we'd stop and see a fresh group of mushrooms growing on the side of a fallen tree.
intro: |
  It was deserted and quiet except for the distant sound of birds and insects. The ground was damp and you could still see tiny droplets of water on the moss. Since it was a long weekend, we went on a quick hike at Big Basin Park where the tallest tree reached a height of 293 feet!

  We wanted to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary somewhere special but not too far from home so I opened Google maps and picked a random spot. The great thing about California is that it's full of parks so you have plenty of options. You could drive an hour outside of San Francisco and find yourself in the middle of a forest.

It reminded me so much of this game called [Samorost](http://samorost3.net/)&mdash;otherworldly and surreal." %}
