excerpt:    2014&#58; The year of discovery
short:      Last January, I started compiling my <a href="/life/looking-back-at-2013" target="_blank">favorite stories from 2013</a> and this year, I decided to keep the ball rolling and compiled stories from 2014.

year:       2015
jan-copy:   Storytelling night was one of my favorite memories from last year. Less than 10 of us gathered in a small, cozy bookshop and traded stories that revolved around the keyword “Dream”. My story was about my childhood, growing up, and secrets that I never thought I’d share.
feb-copy:   In February, I packed all my things in one trusty travel pack and flew to Singapore with Jeremie. I had no clear idea of what I was doing but I decided to just let time take its course. I loved it there–the fresh environment, the secret shops tucked in plain sight, the food (yes the food mmmm), and the fact that Jeremie and I were at least not oceans away.
mar-copy:   Since Jeremie had to fly to San Jose for a month-long business trip, I decided to book my own tickets to Indonesia for a month. I went to Bali and Java and it was the best decision I ever made in 2014. You could say it was a life-changing experience.
apr-copy:   After a spur-of-the-moment decision, we flew to Krabi Thailand to celebrate our 7th-year anniversary. We were mesmerized by the bioluminescent planktons and we even got to swim with the sharks in Ko Phi Phi. This was taken on top of Wat Tham Sua (Tiger Cave Temple) after climbing about 1200+ steps.
may-copy:   I went back to Thailand for about 2 weeks despite the news telling me their military declared martial law. I arrived in Bangkok, then took a train to Kanchanaburi, then took multiple transportation services to Amphawa Floating Market where I had the best food experience during my trip, dropped by Ayutthaya to see the famous ruins and temples, then finally rode an overnight train to Chiang Mai where I spent the rest of my wonderful days in Thailand before heading back to Singapore.
jun-copy:   After half a year of being away, I went back to the Philippines near the end of June. My sister gave birth to her second son Niche who is such a cutiepie. Nathan, my nephew, now has a little brother to take care of.
jul-copy:   One of our closest friends just got married! Louwil and Emelio had been secretly engaged since the previous year but announced their wedding a couple of months before the date. Shocked, surprised, and happy, we quickly organized a bridal shower for Louwil a week before the big day.
aug-copy:   Jeremie and I were back to being in a long distance relationship so we devised a plan to keep each other busy while away. We started a small project called “Oh Periscope” where we took turns drawing/writing short stories to help us practice..
sep-copy:   One of the best stories I had of 2014 was when I got back to Singapore with Jeremie. We got engaged after he proposed to me in one of our favorite neighborhoods in Singapore (Tiong Bahru, specifically Yong Siak Street). It was just an ordinary date that became something much bigger.
oct-copy:   Since Jeremie gave me a surprise the month before, I decided to surprise him for his birthday too. We went to Kuala Lumpur for a couple of days and visited the famous Batu Caves. I have yet to write about our experience since I got really lazy with my website. There’s a backlog full of stories waiting to be told, I just need to gather more motivation.
nov-copy:   Ah, and finally December. My highlight for the month would have to be speaking in public and sweating buckets. A friend asked me if I wanted to present something and I went ahead and took the challenge. Pecha Kucha Night was fun even though I was feeling anxious the whole time. This was the cover photo I used for that presentation. My talk was kind of like this summary I have now. Just a recap of my year.
dec-copy:   And since it’s January, we have been running around trying to finish errands for the wedding. It’s 22 more days before the big day and I haven’t even prepared myself because I’ve been so busy with work. Good luck to us! Hah!
