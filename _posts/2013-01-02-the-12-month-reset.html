<p>And when the clock strikes 12 and the people in this little city begin to lighten up their houses, head for the streets, and make a lot of noise, part of me goes into a process of resetting. It starts with an emotional shift–evolving from excitement to anxiety and finally into feelings of warmth. It is followed by vague thoughts of yesterday and the week before that, the month before, the year before, a decade before, ending in an afterthought of unanswered questions and senseless episodes.</p>
<p>By morning, my mind begins to visualize the days ahead. My body is refueled with energy and I feel an utmost need to see the glare of light outside the window. Only then will I realize that yesterday was merely a dream and my reality has just began.</p>
<p>I don’t quite understand it yet, but the first day of the year always gives me hope. It’s a little weird but I feel that my body resets itself when the calendar strikes at the 1st of January. It’s as if everything I’ve done yesterday was just something I did last year and I’ve been given this chance to start all over again–a chance to do better and to live life the way it should be lived.</p>
