Here's another fun fact about me: I'm always paranoid. I guess this is one of the reasons why it's hard for me to trust people. I've always wanted to find out how I got into this habit, when it started, and what triggered it.

Was I naturally paranoid as a kid?

They say that paranoia can keep a person alive, but I believe that just as it saves, it also destroys. You develop trust issues and isolate yourself from everyone you think will harm you, when all along they are there to help. Sometimes I think about going to see a psychiatrist just to find answers, but I'm afraid it will worsen my case.

*There is a hole in the sky that sucks people into space.*

We were playing hide & seek when we were kids. I was looking for my brothers inside my parents' room when something caught my attention and stopped me in my tracks to look out the window. In the middle of a sunny afternoon, a slow-moving light was trailing in the sky. Lines formed and started falling from the sky. I didn't see them reach the ground, but I swear they looked pretty strange. Almost otherworldly.

I don't know what they were and I always thought that people fell from the sky after being sucked into space while they were sleeping. Nobody remembers. It was just a dream.
