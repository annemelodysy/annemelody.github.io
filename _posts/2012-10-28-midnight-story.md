The girl that lived in my head has returned. I thought I'd controlled her, locked her in a room and swallowed the key. But she's stubborn.

I look at her with pity&mdash;she's weak, has no sense of logic, can't even control her own emotions. But there's something that binds us together.

Her words don't make sense as she speaks at a thousand words per minute. When she finally stops to take a breath, they form into shapes.

The walls now seem closer, the room narrower as I secretly plan how I'm going to lock her up again. Time is running out. It seems that if I don't come up with something, I'll be stuck in this claustrophobic room with her for the rest of my life.

She senses my fear and starts to tease me.

*There is no way out of here. You need to accept that I am part of you, and you me.*

I cringe at the thought.

I scream. I don't want to hear any more. I close my eyes, hope and pray that this isn't happening and that when I open my eyes, it's all just a dream.

I wait three seconds, then slowly open my eyes.

She's no longer in the room.

I stand up and leave for the door. Just as I'm about to touch the doorknob, a voice whispers in my ear "We are one."
