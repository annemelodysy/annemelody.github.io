*There is no place like home.*

After months of traveling and living in temporary homes, I am coming home to Cebu. It’s been 5 months since I stepped foot in this city but being away allowed me to understand myself and figure out what I want to do with my life.

In Singapore, I learned to save money and value the time you spend with someone you love. In Bali, I learned to be brave by facing fears and [traveled alone](http://annemelody.com/travel/preparing-for-my-first-solo-trip/ "Preparing for my first solo trip") for the first time. In Java, I learned to talk to strangers&mdash;[people I never thought I'd encounter](http://annemelody.com/travel/the-people-you-meet-along-the-way/ "The people you meet along the way"). In Thailand, I found inspiration and my way back to writing and storytelling.

To say that these trips have helped me is an understatement.

But home sounds like a dream to me. I can’t wait to fill my stomach with comfort food, catch up with family and friends, see Nacho’s face when I wake up, visit the beach (oh the beach!), smell the fresh air of the mountains, and possibly do more exercise to keep myself fit for the next trip.

I can’t wait to write about the people, take lovely photographs of my city, catch up with my books, and save for my next adventure.

You might find yourself in a different country as good as yours, but home will always be home.
