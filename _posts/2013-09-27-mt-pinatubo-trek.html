excerpt:    It felt like being on a different planet.
intro: |
  Coming from Clark, we took an expensive tricycle ride to the bus station. It was I think 3 or 4 in the morning, so we were still a bit groggy from lack of sleep. The bus station was a big challenge. We didn't know which bus to take that could take us to a town we weren't familiar with to meet our guide. So we took our chances and took a bus that seemed to be going in the right direction.

  Thankfully, we got there, though we were a little late. Another van ride was to take place, but at least now we were in the hands of the guide.
