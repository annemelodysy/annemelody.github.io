<p>It felt like being in a different planet.</p>
<p>Coming from Clark, we took an expensive tricycle ride to the bus station. It was I think 3 or 4 in the morning and we were still a bit groggy from lack of sleep. The bus station was a big dilemma. We didn't know which bus to take so we could meet with our tour guide in some town that we were not familiar with. Anyway, we took our chances and rode a bus that seemed to be going to the town.</p>
<p>And thankfully, we were able to find the place (though a little late). Another van ride was to take place but at least now we were in the hands of the tour guide.</p>

<p>After taking this photo, she gave out a small laugh probably already used to people taking pictures of her. She did her own pose which I assume she learned from previous photographers or she is clearly a natural at this.</p>
