  <p>My memory is starting to alter. If it weren't for these pictures, I would've forgotten what it was like to be there. And this is why I write&mdash;to remember the things that I encountered.</p>
  <p>What brought me to this city? I realize I have few memories of it. After seeing countless temples, my brain became passive and left out details. Ayutthaya is a lovely place if only I'd paid more attention to it.</p>
  <p>To explore the city, you can either rent a bike or hire a tuk-tuk, which is more expensive if you're traveling alone. I attempted to get on a bike, but my lack of experience betrayed me. I ended up walking around the city under the scorching heat.</p>
  <p>Hours later, I met a man driving a tuk-tuk who offered to take me to the temples. My budget was limited, so I negotiated on the price until we came to an agreement.</p>
  <p>He told me he used to work in Singapore as a driver but missed Thailand so much that he decided to come home. The intolerable heat made it difficult to focus on our conversation, so I only remember pieces of it.</p>

  <p>There weren't a lot of things to do at night. The house I stayed was two minutes from one of the famous evening markets in Ayutthaya. The smell of fried fish and spices filled the air. I bounced from one stall to the next, nibbling on bite-sized food until I was satisfied.</p>

  <p>When it was time to go, the owner of the house drove me to the train station. She didn't ask me money for the ride, and once again, it restored my faith in humanity. Everyone I encountered in Thailand was nice. They smiled a lot, were curious, and always wanted to help when needed.</p>
  <p>The train arrived, and I said goodbye to the city as quickly as I said hello.</p>
