  I was sifting through photos from last year when I came across our Mendocino trip. It's a charming suburban town north of San Francisco that had an old-fashioned feel to it. Despite not having grown up in this country, I was overcome with a feeling of nostalgia. I must've read about it in books or saw scenes in films, I'm not sure but it felt so familiar.

  We rented a canoe and paddled our way up the Mendocino river. We've never been in a canoe before but it was easy to get the hang of it. As long as we synchronized our movements and agreed to a direction, we were pretty much on our way. Give it a few minutes, and it will feel like second nature.

  When our arms became too tired, we'd draw our paddles in and let the slow current carry us.

  We ate fresh strawberries and sat in silence for the next few minutes. This gave us a chance to appreciate the plants growing on the edges of the river and say hi to other folks drifting in the water along with us.
