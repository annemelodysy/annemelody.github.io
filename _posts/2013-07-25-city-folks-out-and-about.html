<p>When we were kids, I really didn’t think much about our visits to Surigao (My mother’s hometown here in the Philippines). The only excitement I remember about the trip was when we were in the boat and I’d stay up all night just to stare at the bubbles in the ocean.</p>
<p>There were things that I never got to see as a kid. For instance, our old ancestral home that I wasn’t able to visit because I was sick with fever and they left me sleeping in my aunt’s house in the city. Only now that it’s swallowed back into the forest did I wish I saw it when it was alive.</p>
