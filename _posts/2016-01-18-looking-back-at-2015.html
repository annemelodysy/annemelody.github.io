excerpt:    2015 was about taking big leaps and discovering new places. It was about starting a new life and figuring out how to stand on our own feet without the comforts of home. We've faced a few bumps in the process, but we continue to learn and understand that change is inevitable.

jan-copy:   <strong>01.24.2015</strong> &#9290; Can you believe it? After eight wonderful years of being together, Jeremie and I finally got hitched. Our small and intimate wedding was as we imagined&mdash;filled with warmth and laughter. We are very thankful that our family and closest friends were there to witness our big day.

feb-copy:   <strong>Hong Kong</strong> &#9290; was my first international travel as a kid, so it always has a place in my heart. Coincidentally, Jeremie and I also went there for our first international trip. There's something about it that keeps pulling me back; The third time with my closest friends!
mar-copy:   <strong>Boracay</strong> &#9290; After shivering in Hong Kong, my family and I went to <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/boracay" target="_blank">sunny Boracay</a>. I figured it would at least be nice to spend time with family under the sun before packing my bags and moving to a colder place on the other side of the ocean.
apr-copy:   <strong>San Francisco</strong> &#9290; This is the highlight of my 2015! Jeremie's work brought him to San Francisco, but I couldn't go with him in February because our marriage certificate was still in process. It finally came out in April, and I immediately applied for my visa. A week later, I had my <a href="http://annemelody.com/life/off-to-new-places" target="_blank">one-way ticket to San Francisco</a>.
may-copy:   <strong>Other side of the ocean</strong> &#9290; We are in this new and exciting place and can't wait to hit the road. Our friends in the city invited us to a scenic drive to <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/the-great-big-ocean" target="_blank">Point Reyes</a>. Safe to say, my mind was blown to pieces when I saw the immensity of the ocean.
jun-copy:   <strong>Monterey</strong> &#9290; Drawn to the sea and anything that's in it, Jeremie and I devised a plan to visit the Monterey aquarium. It's a two-hour drive from home, so we rented a car and drove all the way there. It is unquestionably my favorite aquarium thus far.
jul-copy:   <strong>Matt Davis Trail</strong> &#9290; We went on a spontaneous trip one weekend with Jeremie's friend Cody and our neighbor Mike (whom we had just met that day) to Mount Tamalpais. Totally unprepared, I wore flipflops and rompers thinking it was going to be a walk in the park. I survived that ordeal and was <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/matt-davis-trail" target="_blank">rewarded with the best view</a>!
aug-copy:   <strong>Oregon Star Party</strong> &#9290; As if our Matt Davis Trail hike wasn't enough! In August we joined the annual <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/oregon-star-party" target="_blank">Oregon Star Party</a>, which as the name implies, is a star-filled camping experience where people bring their telescopes and experience the wonders of the universe. It was so surreal!
sep-copy:   <strong>Yosemite</strong> &#9290; We drove for four hours to Yosemite National Park. On the way, we stopped at a small town with an old western feel to it. I guess we should have skipped that stop because when we got to Yosemite, it was full of cars. As soon as we parked, we only had time for a brief walk before the sun started to vanish. We'll come back this year.
oct-copy:   <strong>Passion Pit in San Francisco</strong> &#9290; Instead of celebrating our first Halloween here, we went to a concert. I mean who would want to miss watching this band live?
nov-copy:   <strong>Happy Birthday Jeremie</strong> &#9290; We started saving up for our big trip in December, so we didn't travel much in November. We gave Jeremie a surprise on his 28th birthday. Cheers to a brand new year of adventures! Photo by&#58; Robbie.
dec-copy:   <strong>Honeymoon</strong> &#9290; I am happy to say that we finally made it to <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/reykjavik" target="_blank">Iceland</a> for our honeymoon. We saved up all year for our 21-day Eurotrip and finally set foot in Iceland! It wasn't all glitz and glamour. We even almost lost everything while in Cologne, Germany but made it alive with stories to tell. Hopefully, I don't get too lazy to write them down.
