excerpt:    2015&#58; The year of explorations
short:      2015 was about taking big leaps and discovering new places. It was about starting a new life and figuring out how to stand on our own two feet without the comforts of being with our dearest family and friends. We've faced a few bumps in the process, but we continue to learn and understand that change is inevitable.

    <h3>January</h3>
    <p>Can you believe it? After eight wonderful years of being together, Jeremie and I finally got hitched. Our small and intimate wedding was as we imagined--filled with warmth and laughter. We are very thankful that our family and closest friends were there to witness our big day.</p>

    <h3>February</h3>
    <p>Hong Kong was my first international travel as a kid so it always has a place in my heart. Coincidentally, Jeremie and I also had our first international trip here. There's something about this place that always keeps me coming back...this time with my closest friends!</p>

    <h3>March</h3>
    <p>After shivering in Hong Kong, my family and I went to sunny <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/boracay/">Boracay</a>. I figured it would at least be nice to spend time with family under the sun before packing my bags and moving to a colder place on the other side of the ocean.</p>

    <h3>April</h3>
    <p>This is easily the biggest event of my 2015! Jeremie's work brought him to San Francisco but I couldn't fly with him in February because our marriage certificate was still being processed. Fortunately, it came out in April and I immediately applied for my visa. A week later, I had my one-way ticket to <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/rediscovering-the-meaning-of-being/">San Francisco</a>.</p>

    <h3>May</h3>
    <p>We are in this new and exciting place and we can't wait to hit the road. Our friends in the city invited us to a <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/on-the-road/">scenic drive</a> towards <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/the-great-big-ocean/">Point Reyes</a>. Safe to say, my mind was blown into bits when I saw the grandness of the ocean.</p>

    <h3>June</h3>
    <p>Drawn to the ocean and anything that's in it, my husband and I devised a plan to visit the Monterey aquarium. Monterey is just a two-hour drive from home so we rented a car and drove all the way there. Probably one of my favorite aquariums thus far.</p>

    <h3>July</h3>
    <p>We went on a <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/matt-davis-trail/">spontaneous trip</a> one weekend with Jeremie's friend Cody and our neighbour Mike (whom we had just met that day) to Mt. Tamalpais. Totally unprepared, I wore sandals and rompers thinking it was going to be a walk in the park. Fortunately, I survived that ordeal and we were rewarded with the best view of the mountains!</p>

    <h3>August</h3>
    <p>As if our hike through Matt Davis Trail wasn't enough, in August we participated in the annual <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/oregon-star-party/">Oregon Star Party</a> which is, as the name implies, a star-filled camping experience where people bring their telescopes and experience the wonders of the universe. It was so surreal!</p>

    <h3>September</h3>
    <p>We drove for four hours to Yosemite National Park. On the way, we made several stops including a small town with a very old western feel to it. I guess we should have skipped that part because when we got to Yosemite, it was already full of cars. As soon as we parked, we only had time for a brief walk before the sun had started to vanish. We'll come back this year.</p>

    <p>Passion Pit came to San Francisco! Instead of celebrating our first halloween here, we went to a concert. I mean who would want to miss watching this band?</p>

    <h3>November</h3>
    <p>We started saving up for our big trip in December so we didn't go out much in November. We gave Jeremie a simple surprise on his 28th birthday. Cheers to a brand new year of adventures. </p>

    <h3>December</h3>
    <p>I am happy to say that we finally made it to Iceland for our honeymoon. We saved up all year for our 20-day Eurotrip and we finally set foot in our dream vacation! It wasn't all glitz and glamour, and we even almost lost everything while we were there but we survived with stories to tell. Hopefully I don't get too lazy to write them down.</p>
