  <p>An afternoon spent under the sun is always a pleasure especially when there's a lot of space to move in. My eyes trail the wires and wires connected by wooden posts. It's like walking over a thin rope, you concentrate on your path until you reach your destination satisfied, safe, sound.</p>

  <p>Yes it led me, it led me to infinity. Infinity is where the sky collides with the ocean. If we traveled at the speed of light, would we realize that infinity has an end? We'll never know so enjoy the journey and take in as much as you can.</p>

  <p>A set of colored buttons lie motionless in the middle of the fields. We examined it, looking at every angle to determine what they were for.
