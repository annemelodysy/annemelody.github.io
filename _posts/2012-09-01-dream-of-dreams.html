<p>I took a step back, stared at the sky for a bit. The clouds sit on top of each other, moving ever so slowly away from where I was standing. I look at my slippers. They remind me of places I’ve traveled far across the sea.</p>

<p class="mtop2">An afternoon spent under the sun is always a pleasure especially when there’s too much space to move in. My eyes trail through the wires and wires connected by wooden posts. It’s like walking through a thin rope, you concentrate on your path until you reach your destination satisfied, safe, sound.</p>

<p class="mtop2">Yes it led me, it led me towards infinity. Infinity is where the sky collides with the ocean. If we traveled with the wind or with light, we might just figure out that infinity has an end. But we don’t. So enjoy the journey and take in as much as you can.</p>

<p class="mtop2">We stumbled upon a set of colored buttons in the middle of the fields. We examined it, looking at every angle to determine what it was for. The curiosity in me reached out and pressed one of the buttons. To our surprise, it triggered a gentle hum in the air, followed by a gush of wind that made the newspapers dance in the air.</p>

<p class="mtop2">The city I live in is beautiful. It is not the richest place in the world, but it is beautiful. Who wouldn’t love the 30-minute trip to the beach? or the peeking mountains, or even the cozy little shops that grow in hidden corners?</p>
