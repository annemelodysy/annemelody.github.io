When we were kids, I didn’t think much about our visits to Surigao (my mother’s hometown). The only excitement I remember about traveling was when we were on the boat. I’d stay up all night staring at the bubbles in the dark water.

There were things that I never got to see. The only time my mom wanted to take me to our ancestral home, I was sick with a fever. They went without me as I slept in my aunt’s house in the city. Only now that it’s swallowed back into the forest do I wish I saw it when it was alive.
