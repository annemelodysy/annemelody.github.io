When we were kids, I didn't think much about our visits to Surigao (my mother's hometown). I remember being excited about traveling on a boat. I'd stay up all night staring at the bubbles forming in the dark water.

There were things that I never got to see. The only time I had a chance to visit our ancestral home, I was sick with a fever. They went without me as I slept in my aunt's house in the city. Only now that it's swallowed back into the forest do I wish I saw it when it was alive.
