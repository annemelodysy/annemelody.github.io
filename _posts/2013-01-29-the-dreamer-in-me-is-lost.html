    <p>The dreamer in me is lost and I shall go and find it.</p>
    <p>I've been staring at the looking glass for far too long now and I've come to the conclusion that I have lost a part of me that I love--the part that dreams and do things without much thought or care about what people think.</p>
    <p>My perspective has been shifting like a ship sailing in the middle of a storm. I've lost sight of what it's like to see the clouds dance or hear the frogs croak in the middle of a rainy night. I've forgotten the essential smell of dirt, the taste of flowers wrapped in layers of sunshine, the feel of tiny air balloons as they collide and disappear into thin air.</p>
    <p>I miss the fun of being on an adventure and discovering things. Of being able to fly inside my own head and dance when no one's looking.</p>
    <p>I miss it so badly.</p>
