intro: |
  It's been eight months since we moved into this city. It doesn't feel that long since we unpacked our luggage and called this tiny apartment our new home. But the light summer clothes that hung in our closet when we first arrived have now turned into cozy sweaters and thick coats. It's cold outside. I've never been a cold-weather type of person. I don't get excited by boots and scarves or snow (thankfully, there's no snow in San Francisco). But I'm slowly adjusting. Besides, it gives me an excellent excuse to drink all the hot chocolate I want. Hah!

  These past few months, we've been saving up for our long-overdue honeymoon, so we've held off on some indulgences. San Francisco is expensive, so we thought of ways to entertain ourselves without spending too much. One way to achieve it is to explore the city, taking in all the things that make it beautiful and unique.
