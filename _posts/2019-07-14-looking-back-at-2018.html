excerpt:    The year of knowledge
short:      Last year, I focused on learning new things&mdash;from photography to pottery, seaweed foraging and learning to ride a bike in the streets of San Francisco&mdash;it was about improving myself by acquiring new skills.

jan-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Exploring composition</strong> &#9290; I wanted to get better at photography, so I enrolled in a class at a photography center close to home. It gave me a chance to share my work with other people and gather feedback.
feb-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Bouldering in Bishop</strong> &#9290; After fracturing my ankle in 2017, I've learned to slow down and not put too much pressure on myself. It took some time to heal, but it did not stop me from going on this trip.
mar-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Cross-country train experience</strong> &#9290; I took an Amtrak train across the country and watched the landscape change as we traveled from state to state. Read about that trip <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/my-four-day-journey-from-san-francisco-to-new-york-by-train" target="_blank">here &#8605;</a>
apr-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Seaweed foraging</strong> &#9290; There are so many different kinds of seaweed! Growing up in Cebu, I thought I'd seen it all, but apparently, there's more out there. We learned, gathered, and dried our own weed. 😏
may-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Cebu & Bohol</strong> &#9290; Nothing beats going home, seeing family and friends, lounging by the beach, while enjoying fresh seafood!
jun-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Pottery class</strong> &#9290; A welcome change from being on the computer all the time. Shaping clay was like a form of meditation.
jul-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Met up with old friends in LA</strong> &#9290; We're starting a tradition of meeting up at least once a year. I became friends with these ladies in grade school, and now we're all here in the US living in different cities.
aug-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Accepted an offer for full-time work</strong> &#9290; After a year of doing contract work so that I could travel freely, I took a chance and accepted a full-time role. This time, however, I'm allowed to work from home.
sep-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Our first bear sighting in Colorado</strong> &#9290; While driving down one morning, we spotted a brown bear casually walking towards us. Our first wild bear sighting was, ironically, in a residential neighborhood.
oct-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Weekly food delivery service</strong> &#9290; Trying to be healthy while working busy schedules, we signed up for a local food delivery service. Here's to being healthier!
nov-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Trip to Japan</strong> &#9290; This trip was truly magical. We spent two weeks in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Naoshima island, where I finally got to test my bike-riding skills. It was like a dream come true. Read about it <a href="{{ site.url }}/travel/naoshima-island-an-exploration-into-art" target="_blank">here &#8605;</a>
dec-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Joshua tree</strong> &#9290; A drive to the desert to see the strange-looking trees. Something you don't see every day. Unless maybe if you live there.
