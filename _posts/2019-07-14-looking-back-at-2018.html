excerpt:    The year of knowledge
short:      Last year, I focused on learning new things&mdash;from photography to pottery, seaweed foraging and learning to ride a bike in the streets of San Francisco.

jan-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Exploring composition</strong> &#9290; I wanted to get better at photography, so I enrolled in a class at a photography center close to home. It gave me a chance to share my work with other people and hear their thoughts about my work.
feb-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Bouldering in Bishop</strong> &#9290; After fracturing my ankle in 2017, I decided that the best place to rebuild my foot muscle is to climb in Bishop. Jk. Jeremie did most of the climbing. üòÇ
mar-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Cross-country train experience</strong> &#9290; I took an Amtrak train ride across the country and watched the landscape change as we sailed from state to state. Read about that experience <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/my-four-day-journey-from-san-francisco-to-new-york-by-train" target="_blank">here &#8605;</a>
apr-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Seaweed foraging</strong> &#9290; There are so many different kinds of seaweed! Growing up in Cebu, I thought I'd seen it all, but apparently, there's many different kinds. We learned, gathered, and dried our own weed. üòè
may-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Cebu & Bohol</strong> &#9290; Nothing beats going home seeing family and friends, lounging by the beach, while enjoying fresh seafood!
jun-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Pottery class</strong> &#9290; A welcome change from being on a computer all day. Shaping clay was like meditating. It didn't come naturally for me, but once it did, it felt satisfying.
jul-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Met up with old friends in LA</strong> &#9290; We're starting a tradition of meeting up at least once a year. We've been friends since grade school, and now we're all here in the US living in different cities!
aug-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Accepted an offer for full-time work</strong> &#9290; After a year of doing contract work so that I could travel freely, I took a chance and accepted a full-time job. This time, however, I'm allowed to work from home so I can still sort of travel every now and then.
sep-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Our first bear sighting in Colorado</strong> &#9290; While driving down one morning, we spotted a brown bear casually walking towards us. Our first wild bear sighting was, ironically, in a residential neighborhood.
oct-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Weekly food delivery service</strong> &#9290; Trying to be healthy while working busy schedules, we signed up for a local food delivery service. Here's to being healthier!
nov-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Trip to Japan</strong> &#9290; This trip was absolutely magical. We spent two weeks in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Naoshima island, where I finally got to test my cycling skills. It was a dream come true. Read about our experience <a href="{{ site.url }}/travel/naoshima-island-an-exploration-into-art" target="_blank">here &#8605;</a>
dec-copy:   <strong class="uppercase">Joshua tree</strong> &#9290; We drove to the desert to see the strange-looking trees and climb the many boulders. It's something you don't see every day. Unless maybe if you live there.
