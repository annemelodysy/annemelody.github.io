excerpt:    An afternoon spent under the sun is always a pleasure especially when there’s too much space to move in.
intro:      I took a step back, stared at the sky for a bit. The clouds sit on top of each other, moving ever so slowly away from where I was standing. I look at my slippers. They remind me of places I’ve traveled far across the sea.

The curiosity in me reached out and pressed one of the buttons. To our surprise, it triggered a gentle hum in the air, followed by a gush of wind that made the newspapers dance in the air. One in particular fell on my feet." %}
