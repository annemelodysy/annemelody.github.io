    <p>There are days when I catch myself eavesdropping on a nearby conversation. My ears, like my brain, wander when it's bored. The other day, as I was eating lunch in a small Italian cafe, I was drawn by the conversation between two teenage girls. The cafe was empty except for the three of us and the staff at the counter.</p>
    <p>They talked about the places they’d been. One girl asked about the countries the other had been, and the other responded with a big “Hmm” followed by a “Do I need to list them all?”</p>
    <p>Surprised that such a young girl (probably 15 to 17) had been to so many places, I continued to listen.</p>
    <p>She started with Asia–China, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and so on before moving on to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tanzania, Egypt. Then to a handful of US states, and lastly to Europe. I was amazed. For each country she mentioned, she added a comment about how she felt visiting there with her family.</p>
    <p>As I walked back to the apartment, my mind raced with images of the things she did in the places she visited, and I wonder if there are others like her I could meet in this new city--a city of abundant stories.</p>
