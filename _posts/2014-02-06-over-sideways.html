    <p>There are certainly days when I catch myself eavesdropping on a nearby conversation for amusement. My ears are young and my mind wanders a lot when it is bored. For instance, the other day while I was eating lunch in a small italian cafe, I was drawn by the conversation two teenage girls were having a couple of tables away from me. The whole place was almost empty except for the three of us and the lady at the counter.</p>
    <p>From the sound of it, they were talking about the places they’ve been to. One girl asked about the countries the other had visited and the other responded with a big “hmm” followed by a “Do I need to list them all?”. That statement tickled my fancy. Surprised that such a young girl (possibly 15 to 17) had been to so many places, I continued to listen.</p>
    <p>She started with Asia–China, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and so on before moving on to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tanzania, Egypt. Then to a handful of US states, and lastly to Europe. I was astonished. For each country she mentioned, she added a comment about how she felt visiting there with her family.</p>
    <p>As I walked back to the apartment, my mind raced with images of the things she did in the places she visited and I wonder if there are others like her I could meet in this new city. A city of abundant races and culture.</p>
