    <p>It's exciting, unnerving, mind-blowing. Here we go. My first solo trip. Something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time but have been putting off with different excuses. I wanted to do it before turning 30, so this is the perfect opportunity.</p>

    <p>I'm going to Bali. I've never been but have heard stories and it seems like my kind of place.</p>
    <p>So acting with impulse, I booked my tickets a week ago, and it looks like I ran out of excuses not to go. I spent hours browsing through the internet, researching about what to do and came up with a list.</p>
    <h3>Yoga and meditation</h3>
    <p>Bali is a spiritual place. By chance, I booked a b&b near a place called <a title="The Yoga Barn" href="http://www.theyogabarn.com/" target="_blank">The Yoga Barn</a>. I'm hoping to experience solitude and peace throughout my days there.</p>
    <h3>Organic market</h3>
    <p>Saw this <a title="Ubud Organic Market" href="http://www.ubudorganicmarket.com/" target="_blank">website</a> about a local market in Ubud and thought I'd drop by to taste the fresh local produce.</p>
    <h3>Temples, temples, and temples</h3>
    <p>Curious about the local culture, I'm hoping to visit a few temples and learn about them while there. I'm particularly interested in Hinduism and understanding its significance to the locals.</p>
    <h3>Back roads</h3>
    <p>One reason why I wanted to stay for almost a month is that this will give me time to explore the backroads and off-the-beaten spots. My camera is going to have a swell time.</p>
    <h3>Meet new friends</h3>
    <p>It's something I struggle with on most days. As an introvert, I find it hard to meet new people and instantly connect with them. But I'm hoping this trip will allow me to be brave and talk to strangers.</p>
    <h3>See the beaches</h3>
    <p>Not a priority but I heard it's one of the reasons why people visit the island. I'm not sure about swimming alone though.</p>
    <h3>Learn to eat new food</h3>
    <p>As a picky eater, this will be a challenge, but I will have to try. Travel helps broaden my taste and being alone will push me outside my limit.</p>
    <p>My schedule is pretty loose. I've learned from our trip to Ilocos Norte that allocating more days to your trip is better than having a tight schedule. We'll see what happens. My soul-searching begins next Monday!</p>
