<p>It's exciting, unnerving, mind-blowing, and all the adjectives that end in "ing". This is it. My first solo trip. That one thing I've been wanting to do for a long time but keep giving excuses not to do it. I wanted to do it before I turn 30 so this is the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p class="mtop2">I am going to Bali. I've never been there but I've heard stories about the place and it seems like the kind of place I'd want to be in.</p>
<p>So acting with spontaneity, I booked my tickets a week ago and it looks like I ran out of excuses not to go. I spent hours running around the internet, researching about what to do while I'm there and here are a few things I'm looking forward to.</p>
<h5>Yoga and meditation</h5>
<p>Bali is a very spiritual place and it turns out, I booked a b&amp;b near a place called <a title="The Yoga Barn" href="http://www.theyogabarn.com/" target="_blank">The Yoga Barn</a> so I hope I get to experience solitude and peace during my 25 days there.</p>
<h5>Organic market</h5>
<p>Saw this <a title="Ubud Organic Market" href="http://www.ubudorganicmarket.com/" target="_blank">website</a> about a local market in Ubud and thought I'd drop by to taste the fresh produce.</p>
<h5>Temples, temples, and temples</h5>
<p>I made sure the place I stayed had a temple nearby so I can just walk there from time to time or maybe rent a bike. I am particularly interested in Hinduism and heard there are healers who could tell you about reincarnation.</p>
<h5>Back roads</h5>
<p>The reason why I made sure I stayed there for more than just a couple of weeks is so I can explore the back roads and secret corners. My camera is going to have a swell time, I hope.</p>
<h5>Meet new friends</h5>
<p>This is almost impossible to do due to my brain telling me to avoid this at all cost. My brain is incredibly shy and it runs my life so I have to listen. Though I hope it can be persuaded.</p>
<h5>See the beaches</h5>
<p>Not a priority but I heard it's one of the reasons why people go there. I'm not sure I should go out swimming alone though. Sounds too sad.</p>
<h5>Learn to eat new food</h5>
<p>Due to my picky nature, this will be a challenge but I will have to try if I want to live. Brain, please be kind and let me enjoy the food there.</p>
<p>My schedule is pretty much loose. I've learned from our previous trip to Ilocos Norte that allocating more days to your trip can prove to be worth it. We'll see what happens. My soul-searching begins next Monday!</p>
