      <h3>Hope and the Hopeless</h3>
      <p><b>Darkness</b>. The first thing I saw was darkness. My phone was blinking beside my pillow while playing <i>Where Have You Gone by Carousel</i>. I thought about snoozing it but I realized I had to force myself up because I had important things to do.</p>
      <p>Budi arrived at the front gate just in time to take me to the temple. He’s one of the caretakers of the guest house where I’m staying. When I introduced myself to him last night, his face lit up. “Melody Ghina!” he exclaimed and I laughed and told him Adi had the same reaction.</p>

      <p class="mtop2">It was still dark when we arrived at the Manohara Hotel and the sky showed signs of rain. We were given a torch and a sarong before we could enter the gates of Borobudur.</p>
      <p>While I was asked to pay a hefty sum to enter, Budi said he did not need to pay to get inside. I asked why and he mentioned that he used to work there for many years.</p>
      <p>Budi found us a great spot to see the sunrise. I thought things were going well until I felt a drop of water on my hand. Then there were a couple of drops. It started drizzling and my chance of seeing sunrise was gone.</p>
      <p>Disappointed for the nth time, I took a walk around the top level of the temple hoping to calm my thoughts. An internal monologue began in my head and it told me that I shouldn’t keep expecting things to happen the way I want it. That I have no control. That I should just enjoy where I was–in a beautiful temple full of history. That everything I felt was of no importance compared to the grandness of this place.</p>
