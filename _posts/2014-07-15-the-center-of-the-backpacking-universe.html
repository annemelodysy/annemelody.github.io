    <p>I had gotten over my fear of traveling alone and planned another trip a couple of months later. People told stories about Thailand, mostly negative things, but that didn't stop me from visiting.</p>
    <p>Five days before the trip, there were news that the Thai army declared martial law. Everyone was telling me to reconsider or cancel, but I ignored them, did a bit of research (just to be safe), and took the flight to Bangkok.</p>

    <p>Barricades, chaos, drama&mdash;all these things were playing through my head as I approached the train station inside the airport. When I reached the sky train, I felt all the unnecessary stress leave my body. There were no barricades or chaos or drama. Just people going about their routine as if nothing was out of the ordinary.</p>
    <p>There were no other sounds on the train except for the subtle buzzing of electricity. As we cruised through the dramatic urban landscape, the tone golden and mellow, I almost never wanted to get off the train.</p>

    <p>I booked a charming room with a river view near Khao San a few days back, but a friend who lived in Bangkok told me to avoid the area. So I booked another cheap room just a few minutes by train from the airport just to be safe.</p>
    <p>The dimly-lit room gave one the impression of a hotel in old horror movies. The faded wallpaper and the antique vanity dresser gave me goosebumps while the muted sound of the street traffic made it evoke loneliness.</p>

    <p>Cramped on a corner, there was a narrow window overlooking newer buildings.</p>
    <p>It might be my overactive imagination, but that window looked like it was waiting for someone to jump out of it.</p>

    <p>I was in another world and was close to believing I'd find an old notebook in one of the drawers that held someone's secrets.</p>

    <p>I approached the lady at the reception desk and politely requested for a cab. She asked where I was going and what my plans were for the night.</p>
    <p>“I’m going to Khao San to meet a friend for dinner.” She gazed at her watch and asked if I knew about the martial law happening in the country. I said yes, and she told me they had a curfew. Everyone was supposed to be out of the streets by 10 PM. She made it thoroughly clear that I understood what she was saying and I assured her I would be back before the curfew. I felt like a child being monitored by a parent. <i>Yes, mom, I'll be home before bed.</i></p>

    <p>In Khao San, I saw a few shirtless tourists wearing their swimming attire. Apparently, Bangkok is a beach town.</p>
    <p>Despite the news, Khao San was bustling! It was illuminated by glowing lights that seemed to extend to infinity, crowded with bodies and mouth-watering street food.</p>
    <p>Energized by all the activity, I aimlessly pointed my camera here and there. I took a photo of a street vendor selling fried insects. The next thing I saw was a large hand raised in front of me, gesturing for money. I removed the camera away from my face and saw a makeshift sign she was pointing at with her other hand.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Photo for 10 Baht</span></p>
    <p>Caught off guard, I told her I didn’t know I had to pay for a photo and refused to hand out money. She repeatedly pointed to the sign while hurling words in the air. With no other option, I resorted to showing her my camera screen while deleting the photo. That seemed to satisfy her. I know it sounds cheap, but I wasn't planning on giving money for a picture of something that’s in a public setting.</p>

    <p>I met my friend Zar for dinner. It had been a while since we saw each other--the last time, we were in college campaigning as student councils! Zar had moved to Bangkok to pursue a career, and I thought it would be nice to meet him there.</p>
    <p>We had delicious Tom Yum Soup and Pad Thai.</p>

    <p>We were in the middle of a conversation when the mood inside the restaurant changed. The soap opera showing on the television was interrupted by an announcement. There was a pause as everyone focused their attention on the TV. The message was in Thai, so I had no idea what was being said. I could only assume it was from the army reminding people about the curfew.</p>

    <h3>Feels like home</h3>
    <p>Most of the western customers preferred to eat outside, but we tropical folks prefer to stay inside where there’s air conditioning!</p>
    <p>We walked around after dinner, going through narrow alleys hiding modest shops. I was tempted to buy something for myself, but as a general rule, I try not to purchase anything (except food) on the first day, or I’ll run out of money towards the end of the trip.</p>
    <p>Conscious of the time, I thanked Zar and rode a taxi back to the hotel. There was some traffic on the way back (possibly because everyone wanted to be home before curfew).</p>
    <p>The driver was running his meter as if we were in a wild car chase. I noticed the meter reach 100km/hour on one occasion. When I got to the hotel, it was already 9:58 PM. I passed by the receptionist who had a devious smile that seemed to say “Good job! Now go to your room.”</p>
