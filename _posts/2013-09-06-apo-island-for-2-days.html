excerpt:    Apo is derived from the Filipino word for grandchild.
intro: |
  There's a volcanic island near Dumaguete that we've wanted to visit for some time. Apo island which (according to Wikipedia) is derived from the Filipino word for grandchild. We were all there for one reason&mdash;to witness sea turtles in the wild! Unfortunately, I don't have an underwater camera, so I don't have pictures of the turtles.

  We took a bus at around 3 am at the South Bus Terminal. Jeremie, Vince, and I stayed up all night at Starbucks talking about outer space, games, parallel universe, and other far-fetched stories.

  When we boarded the bus, it was freezing, and I immediately regret not bringing a jacket with me. I eventually dozed off. All night, I shifted on my seat to avoid getting a stiff neck, adjusted my legs so it wouldn't go numb, and woke up every now and then to see where we were.

{% include block-text.html text="Sunlight woke me that morning. The scene on the bus looked unreal partly because it was too quiet and everyone was asleep, and because I was reeling from the lack of sleep. Outside, the sea merged seamlessly with the sky. The water was calm, there were no waves in sight, making the horizon look infinite.

At the southern tip of Cebu, we boarded a ferry, then rode a tricycle, transferred to a jeep that took us to a port where we waited for a small boat." %}
