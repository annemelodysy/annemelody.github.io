<div class="grid grid-center width-half module">
  <p>There's a volcanic island near Dumaguete that we've wanted to visit for some time. Apo island which (according to Wikipedia) is derived from the Filipino word for grandchild. We were all there for one reason&mdash;to witness sea turtles in the wild! Unfortunately, I don't have an underwater camera, so I don't have pictures of the turtles.</p>
  <p>We took a bus at around 3 am at the South Bus Terminal. Jeremie, Vince, and I stayed up all night at Starbucks talking about outer space, games, parallel universe, and other far-fetched stories.</p>
  <p>When we boarded the bus, it was freezing, and I immediately regret not bringing a jacket with me. I eventually dozed off. All night, I shifted on my seat to avoid getting a stiff neck, adjusted my legs so it wouldn't go numb, and woke up every now and then to see where we were.</p>

  <p>Sunlight woke me that morning. The scene on the bus looked unreal partly because it was too quiet and everyone was asleep, and because I was reeling from the lack of sleep. Outside, the sea merged seamlessly with the sky. The water was calm, there were no waves in sight, making the horizon look infinite.</p>
  <p>At the southern tip of Cebu, we boarded a ferry, then rode a tricycle, transferred to a jeep that took us to a port where we waited for a small boat.</p>

  <p>Rock formed by years of waves crashing into it. It seems as though the island used to be submerged in water.</p>

  <p>A staircase led to a narrow, cave-like path where it revealed the resort where we were staying. It was tucked on one side of the island hidden behind rocks.</p>

<div class="grid grid-center width-half module">
  <p>The small bar/restaurant was too pricey for me, but we had no choice since there are only two resorts on the island.</p>

  <p>The water was inviting if it weren't for the venomous sea snakes and lionfish swimming around. We took a swim and were surprised that the water was deep despite the low tide. It was fun snorkeling all day, watching the corals underwater. There were air bubbles coming out from the rocks. The corals and fish looked pretty healthy.</p>

  <p>When the sun wasn't too hot anymore, we went for a walk around the island.</p>

  <p>The next day, we set off to see the turtles. I don't have proof, but we saw several of them&mdash;probably 5 or 6 swimming in the shallow water and eating seaweed. They were very gentle and seemed unafraid of humans. We maintained a safe distance to avoid scaring them off.</p>
