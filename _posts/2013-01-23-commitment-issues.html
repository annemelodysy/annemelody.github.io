<p>They say that admitting is the first step to recovery. This doesn't always makes sense to me but here goes: I admit that I have commitment issues. Yes, I am ashamed of labeling myself as that person who has a thousand ideas and starts things without finishing anything.</p>
<p>Before I go on, let me clarify one thing. No, this is not what you think it is. I'm not talking about my relationships--romantic or not. I'm talking about things that I want to do in life. One minute, I am "passionate" (note the quotes) about writing, the next I find myself staring blankly at x number of stories that I've started and never finished. It has dawned on me that maybe I'm just the type of person who starts things and never gets anything done.</p>
<p>This morning I told myself that I would continue working on this story that I wrote a few days back but I got lazy again. The story is about the idea of being too comfortable and the protagonist's realization that comfort isn't always a good thing. I meant to work on it as a short story so I could finally put it on my blog. But alas, the laziness has taken over and won. Lazy-ass - 85, Melody - 0.</p>
