<p>It always begins with a leap–a long, hard leap. And before I know it, I am floating in an endless sea of stars. For what seems like eternity, I am swimming around in the star-field evening hoping never to touch the ground. And as I follow the invisible path that loops around the corner of the universe, the dark transitions into clouds and clouds and blue sky and more fresh blue sky and I am still flying. Gliding. Swimming.</p>
<p>The adrenaline feels far too real to be a dream. How could I be asleep when I can feel the air on my face?</p>
<p>Blue sky now turns to something more fluid. I see the faint lines of water running past me as I continue to move forward. Even as I close my eyes, I see that there are shapes swimming beside me.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be real right? This could just be a dream.</p>
<p>This could just be…gravity is pulling me down. No, logic is pulling me down and I try to push myself up so I can continue creating pictures but it all crumbles down and all I can see is darkness.</p>
<p>I struggle as mashed up shapes blink around me. There is color, though faint at the end.</p>
<p>Moving, struggling. I wake up.</p>
