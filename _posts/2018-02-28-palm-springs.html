excerpt:    There is beauty in minimal design&mdash;the art of keeping only what's important.
intro: |
  Our visit to Palm Springs was brief and served only as a layover before driving up to LA, then back to San Francisco. It took us all day to drive back home, stopping along the way to grab food and see old friends. Jeremie and I took turns in 2.5-hour intervals. Apparently, that's our limit before we start to lose focus. ðŸ™ƒ

  An oasis in the desert, Palm Springs looked like a set from a vintage movie with its famous mid-century structures. Everywhere you turn, the city was postcard-perfect. Palm trees stretched towards the blue sky while huge mountains peeked in the background.
