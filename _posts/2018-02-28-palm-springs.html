    <p>Our visit to Palm Springs was brief and served only as a stopover before driving up to LA then back to San Francisco. It took us all day to drive back home, stopping along the way to grab food and see old friends. Jeremie and I took turns in 2.5-hour intervals. Apparently that's our limit before we start to lose focus. Weak. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
    <p>An <i>oasis</i> in the desert, Palm Springs looked like a set from a vintage movie with its famous mid-century structures. Everywhere you look, it felt like the city was designed to be postcard-perfect. Palm trees stretched towards the blue sky while huge mountains peeked in the background.</p>

    <p>As much as they are curious and beautiful, deserts make me sad. I could never live in a desert even if I lived in a million-dollar home. It just feels too superficial, forced and...dead.</p>

    <p>We drove around for a few minutes admiring the bungalows with their intricate patterns and colorful doors. There is beauty in minimal design&mdash;the practice of keeping only what's important. That has always been my approach with my work as a designer and when dealing with life in general.</p>
    <p>After a few minutes of taking photos, I started to feel odd. Even though there were no walls, I felt like I was invading someone's privacy and I wondered how many people before me felt the same way as they took photographs of these homes. I put my camera down after the fourth house.</p>

    <p>Down the road, we saw this cool mailbox that looked both futuristic and vintage at the same time. It reminded me of a childhood cartoon I used to watch: The Jetsons. It brought back many fond memories.</p>
