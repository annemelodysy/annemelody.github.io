    <p>I woke up dazed, confused, and wondering where I was. The bed I slept in didn't feel familiar. Sunlight seeped through a tiny gap in the window, while birds and roosters spoke in varied tones outside my room. 7:30 am the clock displayed. I fumbled out of my room and into the porch where the caretakers greeted me with a smile.</p>
    <p>"You like vanilla pancake?" the woman asked me. My instinct told me to say yes, so I nodded before my brain could process the brief conversation. Did she mean pancakes with vanilla ice cream? I don't mind that.</p>

    <p>As I was about to take a seat, a small bark emerged from nowhere. I looked down and saw a hyperactive pup running around my feet. It was so eager for attention that I couldn't take a sharp photo of it.</p>

    <p>Breakfast was a surprise. <i>Vanilla pancake</i> turned out to be a green crepe-like wrap of goodness. It tasted great&mdash;like glutinous rice and not-too-sweet but flavourful. Wrapped inside was a sliced banana that gave the vanilla pancake extra flavor.</p>

    <p>After my meal, I went for a walk. There was a small temple right outside my room. I remember Boy, the taxi driver telling me that they prayed 3 times a day at home. And unlike other religion, had no need to visit the public temples unless there was a big festival.</p>

    <p>Around the neighborhood, I found shops that sold strange-looking knick-knacks. The art scene was also bustling with local artists displaying their paintings and sculptures.</p>
    <p>These square-shaped offerings placed on the floor seemed to be a constant sight. Boy had one in his taxi. He says it's for good luck and prayers.</p>

    <p>Taking a right turn, I found myself walking towards Ubud market. At eight in the morning, it was packed with people selling flowers, spices, fish, and sarongs. I followed a bunch of tourists who had a local guide sharing stories about the market. I can't remember much of what was said, but it proved to be a great way to avoid being noticed as I took photographs of vendors.</p>

    <p>Women are required to wear proper attire before entering a temple. One of the requirements is a sarong. Boy mentioned that good quality sarongs cost about 240,000 IDR ($20.60), but some sellers charge that amount even with lesser quality materials. Since I couldn't tell the difference, I bought the cheapest I could find.</p>
    <p>This woman demonstrated different ways I could wear the sarong complete with compliments to seal the deal. Then it was on. "50,000 IDR," she said. I haggled but only brought it down to 40,000 IDR ($3.50). Not a lot, but who cares. It sounded like a good deal, anyway.</p>
