Decisions have to be made.

Should I stay within my comfort zone or step out of it and possibly live a thrilling life? I’ve never been the type to go beyond that invisible yellow line, but I think it’s time to tiptoe across and face the unknown. The challenge now is where to begin. After much thought, I made a list of things to guide me in accomplishing this new direction.

1. **Try new food.** I'm not adventurous when it comes to food. I tend to hover over the familiar. It's a difficult task, but I need to take baby steps. Start with spicy food, maybe?
2. **Talk to people.** I'm paranoid, and in my head, I see strangers chasing me with a knife as I approach them. It must be the result of watching too many horror movies.
3. **Travel alone.** It's something I’ve wanted to do for so long. I keep putting up excuses not to do it. It's time to be brave and do it at least once.
4. **Take photos of people.** It's so hard to approach strangers, but I might be making a big deal out of nothing.
5. **Wear something interesting.** I need to find a particular style that suits me.

I’ll start with these five things and see what happens.
