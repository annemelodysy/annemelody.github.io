    <p><i>There is no place like home.</i></p>
    <p>After months of traveling around and living in temporary homes, I am coming home to Cebu. It’s been about 5 months since I stepped foot in this city but those 5 months allowed me to explore myself and figure out what I want to do with my life.</p>
    <p>In Singapore, I learned to save money and value time being with someone you love. In Bali, I learned to be brave by facing fears and <a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/preparing-for-my-first-solo-trip/">travelled alone</a> for the first time. In Java, I learned to talk to strangers–<a href="http://annemelody.com/travel/the-people-you-meet-along-the-way/">people</a> I never thought I’d encounter. In Thailand, I found inspiration and my way back to writing and storytelling.</p>
    <p>To say that these trips have helped me is an understatement.</p>
    <p>But home sounds like a dream to me. I can’t wait to fill my stomach with comfort food, laugh and catch up with family and friends, see Nacho’s face when I wake up, discover more interesting stories about the people and places, visit the beach (oh the beach!), smell the fresh air of the mountains, and possibly do more exercise to keep myself fit for the next trip.</p>
    <p>I can’t wait to write about the people, take lovely photographs of my city, catch up with my books, and save for my next adventure.</p>
    <p>You might find yourself in a different country as good as yours, but home will always be home.</p>
