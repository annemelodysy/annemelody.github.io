<p>Times like these make me feel vulnerable.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that came to our city last Tuesday (I wasn’t here then). It couldn’t be the aftershocks that left me numb while my bed shook up and down this morning. It couldn’t be the idea of learning a completely different view of a relationship where two people are separated by water and several digits sitting next to the word “miles”.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just the way the afternoon drags on as I look at the people half-afraid, half-tired, half-unaware. The look of retirement and frustration crumbled between knowing and unknowing.</p>
<p>Times like these make me feel vulnerable.</p>
<p>But still, it’s always a relief to find yourself afraid at times. This just means that you are human and mortal.</p>
<h3>What is your greatest fear?</h3>
<p>I am afraid of not knowing where the Atlantis really is, or if mermaids and aliens really do exist or not. I am afraid of knowing that our existence is merely an illusion, a dream of sort and we are merely living in our head. I fear that there is too much fear in my head that it feels like it’s going to turn into stone.</p>
<p>But amidst all these fear is a clear view of acceptance. Acceptance that life is but a little boat–unstable & tiny compared to the ocean. But through this tiny boat, we shall continue to row towards our destination.</p>
