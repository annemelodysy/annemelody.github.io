  <p>I remember looking at the Pacific Ocean while standing on the shores of Siargao Island with my mom several years ago. The waves stood high above my head, growing, and then exploding in front of me. It wasn't the first time I had seen the Pacific Ocean, but it was the first time I looked at it with different eyes. Curious eyes. I wondered what it was like to cross that ocean. I wondered what it was like to be an explorer on an expedition, sailing through the Mariana trench in an old ship while trying to avoid the sea monsters that lurk below the ocean.</p>
  <p>The Pacific Ocean, the world's largest ocean, is said to be bigger than all the Earth's land area combined. Since most of it hasn't been explored yet, I guess it's safe to say that anything is possible down there.</p>

  <p>Eight years later, I find myself standing on the other side of that ocean with the same curious eyes. The other side of the ocean is just as mysterious, yet it holds a different appeal. Something about the way the waves crash on the shore and how it looks on a greater scale blew me away. The humans below looked like ants compared to the water.</p>

    <p>A narrow path up a mountain gave us a better view though visibility was limited due to the fog. I wrapped my jacket tightly around me as a gust of cold wind blew in my direction.</p>
