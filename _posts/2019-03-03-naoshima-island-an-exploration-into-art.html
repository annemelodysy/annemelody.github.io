  <p>Last year, I set a goal for myself&mdash;to take a leap and ride a bicycle in the city. It was something I'd been putting off for a while because I never really had an incentive to do it.</p>
  <p>I began to take it seriously once we started researching about Naoshima. It's a small island a few hours west of Kyoto known for its art museums. A friend had brought it up when we shared our plans to visit Japan and so, it went on our list.</p>
  <p>Naoshima is small enough that you can explore it in a day or two on a bike or with a car. There is a main highway that loops around the island, but the fun part was cycling through the small alleys and exploring the sort-of-hidden installations.</p>
  <p>It's also best to rent an electric bike that could power through steep hills if you're not as experienced with riding. There are several rental spots to choose from near the port when you get to the island.</p>
  <p>For two days, the weather alternated between sunny to drizzling, and we had mostly gray skies while we were there. What proved to be rewarding was waking up early in the morning and taking the first ferry from Uno port to Miyanoura port. The sky's tone was warm making our journey to the island magical.</p>

  <h3>Museums</h3>
  <p>The museums themselves were works of art, therefore photography was not allowed. My initial reaction (as someone who's glued to her camera) was of disappointment but later realized this made me focus on the artwork. Another benefit of this rule is that nobody was blocking the exhibits.</p>
  <h3>Some of my favorite works</h3>
  <p>I rely so much on photographs when I need to remember experiences that move me. But since I couldn't take them, I'm going to compensate by describing them as best as I can. Here are three of my most favorite works:</p>

  <h4>I. Time/Timeless/No Art by Walter De Maria</h4>
  <p>We entered an expansive concrete room bathed in natural light from a rectangular hole in the roof. It was a stark contrast from the dark, narrow hallway that led to this room.</p>
  <p>A series of steps filled the room, and a big shiny, black sphere sat in the middle of the room, sturdy and static. Other objects are symmetrically arranged in the walls, but we were all drawn to the center like moths to a flame. It had an invisible magnetic pull&mdash;this big black orb that sits in the middle. I've read that depending on the time of day, the mood in the room changes.</p>
  <h4>II. Open Field by James Turell</h4>
  <p>I'm a fan of his work, so I was looking forward to seeing them on the island.</p>
  <p>A museum staff dressed all in white whispered directions to a handful of us waiting in line. There was a limit to the number of people who can enter the room at a time.</p>
  <p>After the previous group has left, we were asked to take off our shoes and enter quietly. There are steps in the middle of the room that led up to a large rectangular blue light.</p>
  <p>We started at the bottom then moved up one level at a time, getting closer to the glow of the light. When we reached the top, we were asked to pause longer. I was so close that I wondered how the artist was able to project the light without our shadows casting over it.</p>
  <p>The last thing I expected was for the staff to direct us to step inside the blue rectangle. It was an enchanting moment that I can only describe as like stepping inside a painting. And so I went in and allowed it to swallow me whole.</p>
  <p>Watching people inside was even more surreal. The glow enveloped them as they stood in silence. I felt calm, almost like walking in a dream.</p>
  <h4>III. Backside of the Moon by James Turrell</h4>
  <p>I wasn't sure of what to expect here except that I knew we were going to step inside a completely dark room.</p>
  <p>We were being led inside the dark space, moving slowly in a long hallway. We navigated ourselves to a bench with the use of our hands&mdash;one resting on the shoulder of the person in front of us, the other tracking the contour of the wall. Inside, it was cold, still and my imagination started running as soon as I sat on the bench.</p>
  <p>The staff directed us to look at the front of the room and wait for a few minutes. Unsure about what to expect, it seemed like time was moving remarkably slow. I was stuck in a black hole, helpless and lost.</p>
  <p>After several minutes, my eyes finally adjusted to the darkness and a faint shape appeared in the front of the room. Only then were we allowed to get up and explore the space.</p>
  <p>Intrigued by the object, I walked straight towards it. At first, I assumed it was a floating projection of light. But as I went closer, I realized that it was in fact, a giant hole in the wall.</p>
  <p>The glow was so soft that it didn't appear real. I curiously tested it by poking my head and hands inside the hole. A cool breeze emanated from inside inducing the sense of floating in space. Though anxious at first, now I was in a state of meditation.</p>
