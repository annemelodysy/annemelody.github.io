  <p>The fog rolled over the city as we drove past the famous Golden Gate bridge. After weeks of living in San Francisco, I finally had the chance to see this majestic structure. Grey overcast sky loomed behind it eliciting thoughts of thriller films with giant dinosaurs, superheroes, and aliens.</p>
  <p><em>I wonder if I can cross it on foot?</em> Right then, I saw people hiking/cycling/jogging on a narrow sidewalk. I made a mental note to cross the bridge on foot or with a bicycle. Unfortunately, I need practice. I attempted to ride a bike in Ayutthaya, Thailand and felt like a pancake flipping from one side to the other. I ended up taking a tuk-tuk instead.</p>

    <h3>The Point of Interest</h3>
    <p>Point Reyes is a cape sitting several miles in Marin County, northwest of San Francisco. I googled it a few days ago and fell in love with the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>We stopped by the visitor center. It resembled one of those cabins you see on TV. The lady at the information desk was kind enough to give us a brief idea of what to expect while driving in the park.</p>
  <p>"Watch out for flooding when you're driving in the park." I imagined knee-deep waters, but later realized <em>flood</em> meant an inch of puddle, not the your-car-will-be-swimming-in-water-and-you-have-to-push-your-car-to-its-limits type of flood like we have in the Philippines.</p>

  <p>"Are there wild animals here?"</p>
  <p>She says we can find elephant seals from an overlooking deck, and maybe come across some elks. She drew a circle on our map. I was hoping to see animals in the wild. As someone who grew up watching National Geographic and Discovery channel, I've been dreaming about seeing animals in the wild.</p>

  <p>For lunch, we went to a restaurant called Saltwater. Imagine a quaint restaurant situated near a lake. Everything we ordered was delicious&mdash;from the freshly baked oysters, the arugula salad, and the mushroom and herbs pizza. They didn't disappoint.</p>

  <p>From a window, we could see a tiny slice of forest outside. A restaurant staff came out of that garden with some herbs. He was holding a handful of Arugula. So that's where they get their fresh ingredients!</p>

  <p>Jeremie went exploring while Robbie, Shai, and I bought drinks to keep us warm. After we got our order, I told them I'd meet them in the car after I figured out where Jeremie went off to. He loves exploring! One minute, he's there, the next he's several meters away climbing an abandoned pile of rocks.</p>
  <p>As expected, he was nowhere to be found. I wasn't worried though because he always found his way back.</p>
  <p>"I found a boat!" Jeremie handed me his phone with a picture of a dilapidated, rusty boat in the lake. We examined it and realized it had something written on its side. On the rotten panels, in bold black serif, it read:</p>
