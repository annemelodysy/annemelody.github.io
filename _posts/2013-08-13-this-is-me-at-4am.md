I have drawn to the conclusion that drinking too much tea while getting excited about something has its side effects. Particularly, leading me to endless twists and turns, an out-of-control hair, and a rather topsy-turvy mind. After countless “I’ll never ever drink tea at night again”, I end up sipping another tall glass of tea, and a body heavily abused.

Then finally at 4 am, it made me think&mdash;if my body doesn’t want to sleep, why should I force it to? I’ve never been a fan of forcing situations. So I stopped resisting and allowed my brain to think more thoughts.

This morning, I was fascinated about how a series of decisions contribute to a person’s being. Every gesture, every word, every thought can become part of us. I thought about how and when children transition into adults. Do we one day wake up from bed and decide to act the way we should? I can’t remember. It’s as if there are portions of my past that I can't seem to piece together.

Reality sometimes takes the blame for why some kids need to grow up fast, but I don't see it that way. I think any experience, no matter how bad it is, is worth going through. It doesn’t make sense at first, it never does. But once you start to accept it, you’ll find that they help you make better decisions&mdash;decisions that we so often take for granted.

Take it like this&mdash;life tastes sweeter once you’ve gone through the hard part.
