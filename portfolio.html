          <li>UX design</li>
          <li>UI design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An assignment project I made for our UX class in early 2016. As I was browsing through Facebook, I frequently come across people who complain about planning their trip so I started interviewing a handful of people to determine what was frustrating about this task. After synthesizing all the information, I ended up with the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>They don't know where to start. There's too much information on the internet.</li>
          <li>They have a specific travel style (history, foodie, nature) and budget (backpacker, flashpacker, luxury traveller).</li>
          <li>Travel blogs are too long to read.</li>
          <li>Authenticity is important. Paid content must be avoided.</li>
          <li>Sharing their trips to other people is very important. On the other hand, they like to ask tips from friends and family who have visited the destination.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on these, I developed a persona of my target user.</p>

      <div class="grid center-6">
        <p>I also narrowed down the problem I wanted to solve: <i>Sylvia needs to find reliable content that applies to her specific style of traveling without going through too much information.</i></p>
        <p>Now that I have my problem statement, I started doing competitive analysis.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="grid center-6">
        <p>The next step was to create the user flow, prioritize features for my MVP, then finally create paper prototypes that I can test easily. The insights I gathered from doing the simple paper prototype test are used to come up with the wireframes as seen below. These again are uploaded into Invision as a low-level prototype for testing.</p>

          <li>Jquery</li>
          <li>Marketing assets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I collaborated with Binnacle Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/bsbodden">Brian</a> to come up with a new logo and branding for Binnacle. After days of picking our brains, we came up with Binny as the Binnacle mascot. We wanted to keep it simple yet fun so I experimented with saturated colors using a nautical theme. I also gave Binny a playful personality.</p>

          <img src="assets/work/binnacle-brand-study.jpg" >
        </div>
        <p>Similarly, the marketing site uses the same nautical theme. The goal was to make it super easy for the users to understand the product by trying it on themselves. Check out Binnacle <a href="https://binnacle.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>UX design</li>
          <li>UI design</li>
          <li>HTML / SASS</li>
          <li>Jquery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On my first few days on the team, I conducted research based on existing data. Understanding the demographics, user interest, and daily routines of the audience was the first step in learning about the product. This helped me come up with a persona and understanding their wants and needs. I also dove in on the code to see what else could be improved.</p>
        <p>With the collaboration of the team, here are things I have accomplished in the first few months:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Modernize code.</b> We started using templates instead of static html for pages that use the same design, reduced inline styles, and used SASS for more structured and readable stylesheets. I also converted some images into svgs so they are scalable and easy to tweak. And lastly, we made it responsive (Initially, they had two versions of the site&mdash;desktop and mobile version) which greatly impacted user experience while cutting development time.</li>
          <li><b>Pagespeed improvements.</b> One of our goals was to improve our ranking in Google so we focused on this simple goal to improve pagespeed. One of the things I did was to optimize images and implement lazyloading so images below the fold not loaded until they come into view.</li>
          <li><b>User-focused processes.</b> Aside from persona generation, I also contributed in improving the way we understood our users. We started doing user interviews and testing products before we launched them, we used heatmaps to identify important content that needed to be prioritized.</li>
          <li><b>Refresh site.</b> Reduced visual clutter by hiding content that are deemed insignificant to our users and improving information architecture.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>One of the biggest problems with the newsletters were that they were non-responsive. Since a lot of the users are viewing their horoscopes on their phone, it was a no-brainer decision to modernize the old newsletters. We also wanted to see if we could increase the CTRs and CTORs while reducing the unsubscribe rate. With thousands of subscribers, we needed to get this right.</p>
        <p>My first step was to reduce the clutter. By giving it enough white space and proper content hierarchy, we allowed subscribers to focus on what's important. The new, cleaner design helped reduce the unsubscribe number.</p>
        <p>My next step was to figure out a way to increase the CTRs and CTORs. Through a series of experiments and testing, we discovered that what worked for this case was having clear and easy to understand links and better clickable images. Narrowing down the content helped direct the users' attention thus increasing click rates.</p>
